# Install Python on Windows
Install Python on Windows 8, 10 & 11
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Feb 28 [ Installation Guides ](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/)
Before you start building GUI applications with Python you will need a working installation of Python on your computer! In this short tutorial we'll work through the steps for getting a working Python install, using the latest Python.
## Installing Python on Windows
Go to the official Python website's [Windows downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download one of the Stable Releases of Python.
![Download the latest version of Python](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/python/python-windows-downloads.png) _You can download any of the stable versions._
You typically want to download the **Windows Installer (64-bit)** for modern hardware. Unless you _know_ you need the 32 bit version, try the 64-bit first.
Once the download is complete, double click the installer to launch it.
![The Python for Windows installer](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/python/installer.png) _The Python for Windows installer. Ensure sure Add python.exe to PATH is checked._
You'll see the installer welcome screen which describes what the installer will do.

Make sure that Add python.exe to PATH is checked in the installer. This makes it easier to use Python from the command prompt -- you just need to enter "python" to start, rather than the full path to the executable.
When you are ready to being the installation you can click _Install Now_.
![Installing Python](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/python/installing.png) _Installing Python._
The install will proceed as normal, installing all the required libraries (including Tcl/Tk for Tkinter). Once complete you can exit the installer.
Open a command prompt and start python by entering `python`. This will start the Python REPL, where you can enter interactive Python code.

## Installing GUI libraries for Windows
Now you have the latest version of Python set up on your computer, you can move to installing libraries you need for creating GUI applications. See below for installation guides for PyQt, PySide & Tkinter on Windows.
  * [Install PyQt6 on Windows](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt6-windows/)
  * [Install PySide6 on Windows](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside6-windows/)
  * [Install Tkinter on Windows](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-tkinter-windows/)
  * [Install PyQt5 on Windows](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt5-windows/)
  * [Install PySide2 on Windows](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside2-windows/)

**Install Python on Windows** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-python-windows/Python books) on the subject.
