# Create GUI Applications with Python & Qt5, 4th Edition now available (PyQt5 & PySide2)
The hands-on guide to make apps with Python
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Dec 28 [ blog ](https://www.pythonguis.com/blog/)
Hello! This morning I released a new update to my PyQt5 book [Create GUI Applications, with Python & Qt5](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt5-book). This is an enormous update, expanding it from 258 to **665 pages** and adding **211 complete code** examples.
To celebrate the milestone the book is [available this week with 20% off](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt5-book). Readers get access to all future updates for free, so it's a great time to snap it up!
![render_pyqt5_small.png](https://cdn.mfitzp.com/media/images/render_pyqt5_small_ZHDkFw6.width-800.png)
This is the [4th Edition of the book](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt5-book) and adds a number of entirely new chapters _including_ MVC-like model views, SQL database-views, plotting with matplotlib & PyQtGraph, custom widgets & bitmap graphics, concurrent programming with threads and processes and theming Qt applications.
Existing chapters have been expanded with more examples and step-by-step guides to using them. All source code shown in the book is available as standalone, runnable, examples to try out and experiment with.

[More info ](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt6-book/) [Get the book](https://secure.pythonguis.com/01hf77bjcgxgghzq88pwh1nqe2/)
Use threads an processes to perform long-running calculations or communicate with remote services, without locking up your applications. Receive data back from threads and processes and display progress bars. Stop and pause running jobs from your UI.
![plotting.png](https://cdn.mfitzp.com/media/images/plotting.width-500.png)
Visualize data inside your applications, using matplotlib or PyQtGraph. Sync plots with external threads to create live updating dashboards to visualize data in real-time.
There is also a [PySide2 edition of the book](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyside2-book) available, which features largely the same content, with examples converted to "Qt for Python". Purchasing either book gets you access to both editions, including any future updates of either.
