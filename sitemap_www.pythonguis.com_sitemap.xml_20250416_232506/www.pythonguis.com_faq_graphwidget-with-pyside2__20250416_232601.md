# graphWidget with PySide2
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Nov 04 PySide2 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
Adri1G | 2020-06-18 09:10:48 UTC | #1
I followed the [Embed PyQtgraph](https://www.pythonguis.com/courses/qt-creator/embed-pyqtgraph-custom-widgets-qt-app/) tutorial. I tried to write the code to use PySide2. But I don't find the equivalent function to remplace graphWidget (PyQt5). Do you have any suggestion?
python ```
# from PyQt5 import QtWidgets, uic # import for PyQt
from PySide2 import QtWidgets
from qtpy import uic
import sys # We need sys so that we can pass argv to QApplication
class MainWindow(QtWidgets.QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    uic.loadUi('mainwindow.ui', self) # Load the UI Page
    self.plot([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [30, 32, 34, 32, 33, 31, 29, 32, 35, 45])
  def plot(self, hour, temperature):
    self.plot(hour, temperature) # PySide2, work but plot out the main window
    # self.graphWidget.plot(hour, temperature) # PyQt5
def main():
  app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
  main = MainWindow()
  main.show()
  sys.exit(app.exec_())
if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()

Hi Adri,
graphWidget is not a function of PyQt5.
graphWidget is an instance of the class PlotWidget imported from the pyqtgraph.

@Adri1G the main problem is you're using Qt.py but not setting which Python Qt API to use and so it is defaulting to PyQt5. See [the Requirements section here for possible values](https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/).
To set that in your code, you can just `import os` and then set the value on `os.environ`.
The following code works for me with PySide2.

```

import os
os.environ['QT_API'] = 'pyside2'
from PySide2 import QtWidgets
from qtpy import uic import sys # We need sys so that we can pass argv to QApplication
class MainWindow(QtWidgets.QMainWindow): def **init**(self): super().**init**()

python ```

  self.plot([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [30, 32, 34, 32, 33, 31, 29, 32, 35, 45])
def plot(self, hour, temperature):
  self.graphWidget.plot(hour, temperature) # PyQt5

```

def main(): app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv) main = MainWindow() main.show() sys.exit(app.exec_())
if **name** == '**main** ': main() ```
That gives the same plot as for the PyQt5 version.

**graphWidget with PySide2** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/graphwidget-with-pyside2/Python books) on the subject.
