# Changing ticks in pyqtgraph objects to strings

Is there a way to change the tics in a line graph to dates or names of months?
martin | 2021-01-14 14:08:56 UTC | #2
Hey, here you go.
python ```
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets
from pyqtgraph import PlotWidget, plot
import pyqtgraph as pg
import sys # We need sys so that we can pass argv to QApplication
import os
import datetime
class MainWindow(QtWidgets.QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    self.graphWidget = pg.PlotWidget()
    self.setCentralWidget(self.graphWidget)
    months = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    temperature = [30,32,34,32,33,31,29,32,35,45]
    self.graphWidget.setBackground('w')
    pen = pg.mkPen(color=(255, 0, 0))
    month_labels = [
      # Generate a list of tuples (x_value, x_label)
      (m, datetime.date(2020, m, 1).strftime('%B'))
      for m in months
    ]
    self.graphWidget.plot(months, temperature, pen=pen, labels=month_labels)
    ax=self.graphWidget.getAxis('bottom')
    # Pass the list in, *in* a list.
    ax.setTicks([month_labels])

def main():
  app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
  main = MainWindow()
  main.show()
  sys.exit(app.exec_())

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()

```

The trick is the labels need to be a list of _2-tuples_ containing the tick value (x value) and the label for that tick. In the example above we're using month numbers 1-10 for the x-axis, so the month labels becomes `[(1, "January"), (2, "February"), (3, "March") ... etc]`
To set the labels you need to get the axis object, and then use `.setTicks()` ...since this can be used to set ticks for both axes, you need to pass it in in a list i.e. `[month_labels]` where `month_labels` is our list of tick labels.
