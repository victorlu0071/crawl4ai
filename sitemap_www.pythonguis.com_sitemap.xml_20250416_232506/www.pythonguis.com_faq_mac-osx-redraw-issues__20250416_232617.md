# MAC OSX redraw issues
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
Steven_Hunt | 2020-11-04 11:52:47 UTC | #1
I'm VERY new to Python and coding but am working hard to get up to speed. I followed some PyQt5 tuts online and where text (labels, fields) and images (Pixmap within labels) need to update on events...they simply don't, unless I click back on my IDE (PyCharm) window OR my system terminal. 
I’m testing files in two environments (system and virtualenv) with same results.
I even tried samples that came with Martin's book and I am getting the same redraw issues, at least thats what I think it is, as updated values do get passed on the event (monitored through print statements). Example: when clearing text in a field it half, clears, leaving fragments (pixel dots) until I click back on IDE or terminal window.
I'm running Python 3.9, PyQT5 on Mac Mojave 10.14.6
