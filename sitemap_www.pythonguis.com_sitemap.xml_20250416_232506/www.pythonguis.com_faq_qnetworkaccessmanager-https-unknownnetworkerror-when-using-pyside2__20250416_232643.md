# QNetworkAccessManager https UnknownNetworkError when using pyside2
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

Hello, I'm using the QNetworkAccessManager module and it works fine with HTTP requests, but when I try to do https requests it fails and returns "PySide2.QtNetwork.QNetworkReply.NetworkError.UnknownNetworkError: TLS initialization failed" this problem only happens with pyside2 on windows. but it works fine on Mac os. when I used the same piece of code with pyqt5 it worked just fine on both Windows and Mac os. https requests: 1.pyside2 on windows: fails 2.pyside2 on mac: works fine 3. pyqt5 on windows: works fine 4. pyqt5 on mac: works fine and I'm stuck with it for a while and can't seem to find the problem.
from PySide2 import QtNetwork from PySide2 import QtCore import sys, json
class Example:
python ```
def __init__(self):
  self.nam = QtNetwork.QNetworkAccessManager()
  self.nam.finished.connect(self.handle_response)
def do_request(self):
  url = 'https://httpbin.org/get'
  req = QtNetwork.QNetworkRequest(QtCore.QUrl(url))
  self.nam.get(req)
def handle_response(self, reply):
  er = reply.error()
  if er == QtNetwork.QNetworkReply.NoError:
    bytes_string = reply.readAll()
    print(str(bytes_string, 'utf-8'))
  else:
    print(f'Error occurred: {er}: {reply.errorString()}')
  QtCore.QCoreApplication.quit()

```

def main(): app = QtCore.QCoreApplication([]) ex = Example() ex.do_request() sys.exit(app.exec_())
if **name** == '**main** ': main()
I'm using python 3.7 and pyside2 5.15
