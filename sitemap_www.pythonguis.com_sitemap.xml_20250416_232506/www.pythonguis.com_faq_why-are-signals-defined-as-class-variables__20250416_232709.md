# Why are signals defined as class variables?

Is there any reason why signals of WorkerSignals are class variables?

This is actually due to how PyQt5 (and PySide2) hook up signals and create Qt objects, and how the order of that relates to their related Python objects.
When you define a signal on a class, e.g.
python ```
class MyWindow(QMainWindow):
  my_custom_signal = pyqtSignal()

```

You are creating an instance of `pyqtSignal` and assigning it to the class variable `my_custom_signal`. However, nothing is happening in Qt here, this is just a simple Python object.
When you create an _instance_ of your `MyWindow` class the Python object is created, the `__init__` is run, the `super()` class is called and _then_ PyQt5 creates the Qt objects, and hooks everything together. At this point PyQt5 searches for signal definitions on the object, and hooks these up using Qt signals (with appropriate magic).

[Take a look ](https://www.pythonguis.com/packaging-book/)
If you defined signals in your `__init__` like you might expect...
python ```
class MyWindow(QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self):
     super().__init__()
     self.my_custom_signal = pyqtSignal()

```

this won't work.... because when you call the _super_ init, PyQt5 will try and hook up the signals, but you haven't defined them yet.
Of course, PyQt5 could _require_ you have to put the `super().__init__` call after you've created the signals....

python ```
class MyWindow(QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self):
     self.my_custom_signal = pyqtSignal()
     super().__init__()

```

...but that's surprising and not very nice.
Putting them on the class side-steps all this.

**Why are signals defined as class variables?** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/why-are-signals-defined-as-class-variables/Python books) on the subject.
