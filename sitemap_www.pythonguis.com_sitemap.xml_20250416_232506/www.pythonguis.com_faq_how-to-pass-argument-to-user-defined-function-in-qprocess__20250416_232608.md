# How to pass argument to user defined function in Qprocess
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
Ganesh_Gupta | 2021-02-22 14:36:13 UTC | #1
python ```
  def calc(self):
    progressBar = self.progressBar
    self.Calculate.setEnabled(False)
    filter = self.SubSectorLevel1.currentText()
    filter1 = self.SubSectorLevel2.currentText()
    IND = self.lineEdit.text()
    OTD = self.lineEdit_2.text()
    Version= self.lineEdit_10.text()
    Year=self.lineEdit_4.text()
    if filter=='Residue Burning':
      if filter1 =='None':
        ARB(IND,OTD,Version,Year,progressBar)
    if filter=='Lightning & Heating':
      if filter1 =='Lighting':
        RKL(IND,OTD,Version,Year)
      elif filter1=='Space Heating':
        RSH(IND,OTD,Version,Year)
      elif filter1=='Water Heating':
        RWH(IND,OTD,Version,Year,progressBar)
    if filter=='Brick Production':
      if filter1 =='None':
        BP(IND,OTD,Version,Year,progressBar)

```

I want to use Qprocess in user defined function like RSH and BP

Hi Ganesh_Gupta Your code is not very clear and readable.

Hi @Ganesh_Gupta welcome to the forum. I've edited the code to make it clearer, but I'm still not sure what you're trying to do.
If you're wanting to run those functions (RKL, etc.) concurrently, it _probably_ makes sense to use threads. If you take a look at the bottom of the [threading tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/multithreading-pyqt-applications-qthreadpool/) there is an example where you can pass a custom function to run on a separate thread.
