# Missing icons when running Notepad example on Raspberry Pi
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Nov 04 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
_Anonymous asks_
> The [notepad application example](https://www.pythonguis.com/examples/no2pads-simple-notepad-clone/) runs without problems on my Raspberry Pi. But the menu bar shows no icons. just blank rectangles. They do work if I click on them. What could be the problem?
_Luca_
Open the file notepad.py and go after this:
python ```
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
  super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

```

add the following lines:
python ```
  icon = QIcon(os.path.join('images', 'blue-flolder-open-document.png'))
  print("availableSizes:", icon.availableSizes())

```

the output on the terminal should be:
python ```
 availableSizes: [PyQt5.QtCore.QSize(16, 16)]

```

if it is different, for example:

**Missing icons when running Notepad example on Raspberry Pi** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/missing-icons-when-running-notepad-example-on-raspberry-pi/Python books) on the subject.
