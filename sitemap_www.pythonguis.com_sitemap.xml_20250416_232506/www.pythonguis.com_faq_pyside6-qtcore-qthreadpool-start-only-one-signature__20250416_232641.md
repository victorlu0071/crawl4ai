# PySide6.QtCore.QThreadPool().start() (only one signature)
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PySide6 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

In PyQt6, there are two signatures for the `start()` method of `QThreadPool()`:
  1. `PyQt6.QtCore.QThreadPool().start(QRunnable, priority: int = 0)`
  2. `PyQt6.QtCore.QThreadPool().start(Callable[[], None], priority: int = 0)`


In PyQt6, you don't need a runnable, just simply pass a callable (a Python function/method) to the `start()` method (that is some sort of a long-running task) and be done with it.
The second signature of the `start()` method of `QThreadPool()` in PyQt6 (listed above) is the only thing that is keeping me away from PySide6, because PySide6 only has one signature for the `start()` method (only the first signature, listed above).
@martin, will PySide6 ever provide the second signature for the `start()` method, so that we won't be forced to create a runnable, but we would be able to simply pass a callable to it?
I wrote to the PySide mailing list asking this same question, but got no response after waiting more than a month. Are you in contact with any of the PySide devs?

`QThreadPool.start(<function>)` is now available in PySide6 as well as PyQt6 & PyQt5. There's a [demo tutorial here showing the usage](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/pyqt-qthreadpool-simple-threading/).
