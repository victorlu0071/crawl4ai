Dialogs are useful GUI components that allow you to _communicate_ with the user (hence the name _dialog_). They are commonly used for file Open/Save, settings, preferences, or for functions that do not fit into the main UI of the application. They are small _modal_ (or _blocking_) windows that sit in front of the main application until they are dismissed. Qt provides a number of 'special' built-in dialogs for the most common use-cases, allowing you to provide a platform-native user experience.

In Qt dialog boxes are handled by the `QDialog` class. To create a new dialog box simply create a new object of `QDialog` type passing in another widget, e.g. `QMainWindow`, as its parent.
Let's create our own `QDialog`. We'll start with a simple skeleton app with a button to press hooked up to a slot method.
python ```
import sys
from PySide2.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QPushButton

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.setWindowTitle("My App")
    button = QPushButton("Press me for a dialog!")
    button.clicked.connect(self.button_clicked)
    self.setCentralWidget(button)
  def button_clicked(self, s):
    print("click", s)

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
window = MainWindow()
window.show()
app.exec_()

```

In the slot `button_clicked` (which receives the signal from the button press) we create the dialog instance, passing our `QMainWindow` instance as a parent. This will make the dialog a _modal window_ of `QMainWindow`. This means the dialog will completely block interaction with the parent window.
python ```
import sys
from PySide2.QtWidgets import QApplication, QDialog, QMainWindow, QPushButton

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.setWindowTitle("My App")
    button = QPushButton("Press me for a dialog!")
    button.clicked.connect(self.button_clicked)
    self.setCentralWidget(button)
  def button_clicked(self, s):
    print("click", s)
    dlg = QDialog(self)
    dlg.setWindowTitle("HELLO!")
    dlg.exec_()

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
window = MainWindow()
window.show()
app.exec_()

```

_Run it!_ Click the button and you'll see an empty dialog appear.

Once we have created the dialog, we start it using `.exec_()` - just like we did for `QApplication` to create the main event loop of our application. That’s not a coincidence: when you exec the `QDialog` an entirely new event loop - specific for the dialog - is created.
The `QDialog` completely blocks your application execution. Don't start a dialog and expect anything else to happen anywhere else in your app. We'll see later how you can use threads & processes to get you out of this pickle.
![Our empty dialog overlaying the window.](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/tutorials/qt/dialogs/dialog1.png) _Our empty dialog overlaying the window._
Like our very first window, this isn't very interesting. Let's fix that by adding a dialog title and a set of OK and Cancel buttons to allow the user to _accept_ or _reject_ the modal.
To customize the `QDialog` we can subclass it.
python ```
class CustomDialog(QDialog):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.setWindowTitle("HELLO!")
    QBtn = QDialogButtonBox.Ok | QDialogButtonBox.Cancel
    self.buttonBox = QDialogButtonBox(QBtn)
    self.buttonBox.accepted.connect(self.accept)
    self.buttonBox.rejected.connect(self.reject)
    self.layout = QVBoxLayout()
    message = QLabel("Something happened, is that OK?")
    self.layout.addWidget(message)
    self.layout.addWidget(self.buttonBox)
    self.setLayout(self.layout)

```

In the above code, we first create our subclass of `QDialog` which we've called `CustomDialog`. As for the `QMainWindow` we apply our customizations in the class `__init__` block so our customizations are applied as the object is created. First we set a title for the `QDialog` using `.setWindowTitle()`, exactly the same as we did for our main window.
The next block of code is concerned with creating and displaying the dialog buttons. This is probably a bit more involved than you were expecting. However, this is due to Qt's flexibility in handling dialog button positioning on different platforms.
You could of course choose to ignore this and use a standard `QButton` in a layout, but the approach outlined here ensures that your dialog respects the host desktop standards (OK on left vs. right for example). Messing around with these behaviors can be incredibly annoying to your users, so I wouldn't recommend it.
The first step in creating a dialog button box is to define the buttons want to show, using namespace attributes from `QDialogButtonBox`. The full list of buttons available is below:
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Ok`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Open`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Save`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Cancel`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Close`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Discard`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Apply`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Reset`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.RestoreDefaults`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Help`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.SaveAll`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Yes`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.YesToAll`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.No`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Abort`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Retry`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.Ignore`
  * `QDialogButtonBox.NoButton`


These should be sufficient to create any dialog box you can think of. You can construct a line of multiple buttons by OR-ing them together using a pipe (`|`). Qt will handle the order automatically, according to platform standards. For example, to show an OK and a Cancel button we used:
python ```
buttons = QDialogButtonBox.Ok | QDialogButtonBox.Cancel

```

The variable `buttons` now contains an integer value representing those two buttons. Next, we must create the `QDialogButtonBox` instance to hold the buttons. The flag for the buttons to display is passed in as the first parameter.
To make the buttons have any effect, you must connect the correct `QDialogButtonBox` signals to the slots on the dialog. In our case we've connected the `.accepted` and `.rejected` signals from the `QDialogButtonBox` to the handlers for `.accept()` and `.reject()` on our subclass of `QDialog`.
Lastly, to make the `QDialogButtonBox` appear in our dialog box we must add it to the dialog layout. So, as for the main window we create a layout, and add our `QDialogButtonBox` to it (`QDialogButtonBox` is a widget), and then set that layout on our dialog.
Finally, we launch the `CustomDialog` in our `MainWindow.button_clicked` slot.
python ```
class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
  # ... add the following method after the __init__
  def button_clicked(self, s):
    print("click", s)
    dlg = CustomDialog()
    if dlg.exec_():
      print("Success!")
    else:
      print("Cancel!")

```

_Run it!_ Click to launch the dialog and you will see a dialog box with buttons.
![Our dialog with a label and buttons.](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/tutorials/qt/dialogs/dialog2a.png) _Our dialog with a label and buttons._
When you click the button to launch the dialog, you may notice that it appears away from the parent window -- probably in the center of the screen. Normally you want dialogs to appear over their launching window to make them easier for users to find. To do this we need to give Qt a _parent_ for the dialog. If we pass our main window as the parent, Qt will position the new dialog so that the center of the dialog aligns with the center of the window.
We can modify our `CustomDialog` class to accept a `parent` parameter.
python ```
class CustomDialog(QDialog):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
    super().__init__(parent)
    self.setWindowTitle("HELLO!")
    QBtn = QDialogButtonBox.Ok | QDialogButtonBox.Cancel
    self.buttonBox = QDialogButtonBox(QBtn)
    self.buttonBox.accepted.connect(self.accept)
    self.buttonBox.rejected.connect(self.reject)
    self.layout = QVBoxLayout()
    message = QLabel("Something happened, is that OK?")
    self.layout.addWidget(message)
    self.layout.addWidget(self.buttonBox)
    self.setLayout(self.layout)

```

We set a default value of `parent=None` so we can omit the parent if we wish.
Then, when we create our instance of `CustomDialog` we can pass the main window in as a parameter. In our `button_clicked` method, `self` is our main window object.
python ```
  def button_clicked(self, s):
    print("click", s)
    dlg = CustomDialog(self)
    if dlg.exec_():
      print("Success!")
    else:
      print("Cancel!")

```

_Run it!_ Click to launch the dialog and you should see the dialog pop up right in the middle of the parent window.

![Our dialog, centered over the parent window.](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/tutorials/qt/dialogs/dialog2b.png) _Our dialog, centered over the parent window._
Congratulations! You've created your first dialog box. Of course, you can continue to add any other content to the dialog box that you like. Simply insert it into the layout as normal.
## Simple message dialogs with `QMessageBox`
There are many dialogs which follow the simple pattern we just saw -- a message with buttons with which you can accept or cancel the dialog. While you can construct these dialogs yourself, Qt also provides a built-in message dialog class called `QMessageBox`. This can be used to create information, warning, about or question dialogs.
The example below creates a simple `QMessageBox` and shows it.
python ```
import sys
from PySide2.QtWidgets import QApplication, QDialog, QMainWindow, QMessageBox, QPushButton

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.setWindowTitle("My App")
    button = QPushButton("Press me for a dialog!")
    button.clicked.connect(self.button_clicked)
    self.setCentralWidget(button)
  def button_clicked(self, s):
    dlg = QMessageBox(self)
    dlg.setWindowTitle("I have a question!")
    dlg.setText("This is a simple dialog")
    button = dlg.exec_()
    if button == QMessageBox.Ok:
      print("OK!")

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
window = MainWindow()
window.show()
app.exec_()

```

_Run it!_ You'll see a simple dialog with an _OK_ button.
![A QMessageBox dialog.](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/tutorials/qt/dialogs/dialog3.png) _A QMessageBox dialog._
As with the dialog button box we looked at already, the buttons shown on a `QMessageBox` are also configured with a set of constants which can be combined with `|` (the binary OR operator) to show multiple buttons. The full list of available button types is shown below.
  * `QMessageBox.Ok`
  * `QMessageBox.Open`
  * `QMessageBox.Save`
  * `QMessageBox.Cancel`
  * `QMessageBox.Close`
  * `QMessageBox.Discard`
  * `QMessageBox.Apply`
  * `QMessageBox.Reset`
  * `QMessageBox.RestoreDefaults`
  * `QMessageBox.Help`
  * `QMessageBox.SaveAll`
  * `QMessageBox.Yes`
  * `QMessageBox.YesToAll`
  * `QMessageBox.No`
  * `QMessageBox.NoToAll`
  * `QMessageBox.Abort`
  * `QMessageBox.Retry`
  * `QMessageBox.Ignore`
  * `QMessageBox.NoButton`


You can also tweak the icon shown on the dialog by setting the icon with one of the following.
Icon state | Description  
---|---  
QMessageBox.NoIcon | The message box does not have an icon.  
QMessageBox.Question | The message is asking a question.  
QMessageBox.Information | The message is informational only.  
QMessageBox.Warning | The message is warning.  
QMessageBox.Critical | The message indicates a critical problem.  
For example, the following creates a question dialog with _Yes_ and _No_ buttons.
python ```
  def button_clicked(self, s):
    dlg = QMessageBox(self)
    dlg.setWindowTitle("I have a question!")
    dlg.setText("This is a question dialog")
    dlg.setStandardButtons(QMessageBox.Yes | QMessageBox.No)
    dlg.setIcon(QMessageBox.Question)
    button = dlg.exec_()
    if button == QMessageBox.Yes:
      print("Yes!")
    else:
      print("No!")

```

_Run it!_ You'll see a question dialog with _Yes_ and _No_ buttons.
![Question dialog created using QMessageBox.](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/tutorials/qt/dialogs/dialog4.png) _Question dialog created using QMessageBox._
## Built in `QMessageBox` dialogs
To make things even simpler the `QMessageBox` has a number of methods which can be used to construct these types of message dialog. These methods are shown below --
python ```
QMessageBox.about(parent, title, message)
QMessageBox.critical(parent, title, message)
QMessageBox.information(parent, title, message)
QMessageBox.question(parent, title, message)
QMessageBox.warning(parent, title, message)

```

The `parent` parameter is the window which the dialog will be a child of. If you're launching your dialog from your main window, you can just pass in `self`. The following example creates a question dialog, as before, with _Yes_ and _No_ buttons.
python ```
  def button_clicked(self, s):
    button = QMessageBox.question(self, "Question dialog", "The longer message")
    if button == QMessageBox.Yes:
      print("Yes!")
    else:
      print("No!")

```

_Run it!_ You'll see the same result, this time using the built in `.question()` method.
![The built-in question dialog.](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/tutorials/qt/dialogs/dialog5.png) _The built-in question dialog._
Notice that rather than call `exec()` we now simply call the dialog method and the dialog is created. The return value of each of the methods is the button which was pressed. We can detect what has been pressed by comparing the return value to the button constants.
The four `information`, `question`, `warning` and `critical` methods also accept optional `buttons` and `defaultButton` arguments which can be used to tweak the buttons shown on the dialog and select one by default. Generally though you don't want to change this from the default.
python ```
  def button_clicked(self, s):
    button = QMessageBox.critical(
      self,
      "Oh dear!",
      "Something went very wrong.",
      buttons=QMessageBox.Discard | QMessageBox.NoToAll | QMessageBox.Ignore,
      defaultButton=QMessageBox.Discard,
    )
    if button == QMessageBox.Discard:
      print("Discard!")
    elif button == QMessageBox.NoToAll:
      print("No to all!")
    else:
      print("Ignore!")

```

_Run it!_ You'll see a critical dialog with customized buttons.
![Critical error! This is a terrible dialog.](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/tutorials/qt/dialogs/dialog6.png) _Critical error! This is a terrible dialog._
For most situations these simple dialogs are all you need.
