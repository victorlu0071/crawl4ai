# Install PyQt5 on Raspberry Pi
Install PyQt5 on Raspberry Pi Raspbian
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Mar 16 PyQt5 [ Installation Guides ](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/)
Before you start building GUI applications with the Raspberry Pi you will need to have a working installation of PyQt5 or PyQt6 on your system. If you don't have either set up yet, the following steps will guide you through how to do this on Windows.
Note that the following instructions are _only_ for installation of the _GPL licensed_ version of PyQt. If you need to use PyQt in a non-GPL project you will need to purchase an alternative license from [Riverbank Computing](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com) to release your software.
## Install PyQt5 on Raspberry Pi Raspbian
Installation on Raspberry Pi is very straightforward as packages for PyQt5 are available in Raspbian repositories. In Raspbian you can install either from the command line using `apt`. The package you are looking for is named `python3-pyqt5`.
You can also install these from the command line as follows --
bash ```
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5

```

After install is finished, you should be able to run `python` (or `python3`) and `import PyQt5` without errors.
python ```
Python 3.7.6
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import PyQt5
>>>

```

You can now start [creating Python GUI applications with PyQt5](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt5-tutorial/).

**Install PyQt5 on Raspberry Pi** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt5-raspberry-pi/Python books) on the subject.
