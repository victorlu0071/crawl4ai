# Creating PySide2 UI without .ui / Qt Designer
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PySide2 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

I want to know if its possible to have a PySide2 code with no ui needed. How can I write the widgets into the window without the qtcreator file.

The [beginner tutorial here](https://www.pythonguis.com/courses/start/creating-your-first-window/) also now has both PyQt5 & PySide2 code. I'm adding PySide2 code to the other tutorials as I update them.
