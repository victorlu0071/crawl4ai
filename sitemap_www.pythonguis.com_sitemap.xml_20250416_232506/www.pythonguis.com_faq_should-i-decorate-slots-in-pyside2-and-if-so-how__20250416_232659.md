# Should I decorate slots in Pyside2 and if so how?
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PySide2 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

Should I decorate slots in Pyside2 and if so how?
Example code of 2 different slots:
python ```
def createActions(self):
  buttonTriggered = QAction('Button Triggered', self)
  buttonTriggered.triggered.connect(self.onButtonTriggered)
  buttonToggled = QAction('Button Toggled', self)
  buttonToggled.setCheckable(True)
  buttonToggled.toggled.connect(lambda checked: self.onButtonToggled(checked))
def onButtonTriggered(self):
  pass
def onButtonToggled(self, checked):
  pass

```

Thanks

Hi RaSt welcome to the forum. You can decorate PySide2 slots the same way you do for PyQt5, just using the decorator
python ```
from PySide2.QtCore import Slot
@Slot
def slot
  pass

```

def slot
  pass

```

...for PyQt5.
As to whether you _should_ decorate the slots, it's a little trickier to answer -- but generally speaking no, you don't need to.
The only place I know the slot decorator is needed is when a) using threads, as it ensures the decorated method is started in the correct thread, or b) when you want to explicitly map a given slot to a specific call signature (types) in C++.

In your examples, the slots are running in the GUI thread and signal/slots are single-typed, so you don't need them.

Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/should-i-decorate-slots-in-pyside2-and-if-so-how/Python books) on the subject.
