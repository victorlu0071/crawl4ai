# setCurrentIndex() says it receives NoneType
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
Cody_Jackson | 2021-03-11 20:16:42 UTC | #1
I want to take multiple selections from a treeView of a file system and process them sequentially, like a batch job. If there's a better way than what I discuss below, I would greatly appreciate it.
I have the following code:
python ```
  def add_item(self):
  """Add Project Explorer selected asset to Working Directory"""
  indexes = self.project.treeView.selectedIndexes()
  for index in indexes:
    self.console_output.on_update_text(index) # Just to verify data type
    self.project.build_project(index)

```

I know that each index is a Qt index object because the error returned is 
python ```
TypeError: arguments did not match any overloaded call:
  insertText(self, str): argument 1 has unexpected type 'QModelIndex'
  insertText(self, str, QTextCharFormat): argument 1 has unexpected type 'QModelIndex'

```

The `build_project()` code is below:
python ```
def build_project(self, item):
  if item:
    index = self.treeView.setCurrentIndex(item)
  else:
    index = self.fileSystemModel.filePath(self.treeView.currentIndex())
  index_path = Path(index) # Convert string to path-type
  parent_dir = index_path.parents[0] # Get the path to the /opencpi/projects directory
  out = subprocess.run(["bash", "-c", f"source {self.default_dir}/cdk/opencpi-setup.sh -r && cd {parent_dir} && "
                    f"ocpidev build project {index_path.name}"],
             stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
  self.console_output.on_update_text(out.stdout.decode()) # Send command output to console

```

If I remove the console_output line in `add_item()` and pass the index to `build_project()`, I get the following error:
python ```
 <removed for clarity>
 ...
 File "/home/toor/PycharmProjects/ie-gui/OpenCPI_GUI.py", line 991, in build_project
  index_path = Path(index) # Convert string to path-type
 ...
 TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType

```

I've tried a number of different things and can confirm that the index values generated by `add_item()` are QModelIndex values. Since the singular creation of the index via `self.treeView.currentIndex()` works, I don't understand why `setCurrentIndex()` doesn't work, much less why it claims a None value is being provided.

**setCurrentIndex() says it receives NoneType** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/setcurrentindex-says-it-receives-nonetype/Python books) on the subject.
