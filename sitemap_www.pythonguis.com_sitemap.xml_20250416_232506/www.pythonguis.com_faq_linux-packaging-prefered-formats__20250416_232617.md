For Linux users, what Packaging format do you prefer your apps delivered in? _(I'm not asking about which you prefer to package your stuff with but what packaging you prefer apps to be in?)_
Debian files *.deb Snappy packages AppImages tar.gz Something else?....

My favourite format is **deb**. Mainly because I use Mint and Ubuntu distributions.

Hi , 
[Packaging Python Applications with PyInstaller](https://www.pythonguis.com/packaging-book/) _by Martin Fitzpatrick_ — This step-by-step guide walks you through packaging your own Python applications from simple examples to complete installers and signed executables. 
[More info ](https://www.pythonguis.com/packaging-book/) [Get the book](https://secure.pythonguis.com/01hf77hrbf5v8z5kjtwbhmbwjz/)
In fact, its depends on which distribution (and sometimes your desktop environment !) you are using. 
For sample for me. Even I still had two Ubuntu (or derivative) one on my laptop and a secondary (an Linux mint in fact) in a external DD, I use mainly Manjaro , one with Cinnamon and another one with Deepin. And on Manjaro and all derivative distribution coming from ArchLinux, we don't use deb. And we install PyQt app either with a PKBUILD for an app on AUR, either with PyPi if she not available on AUR. Either directly with the setup. 
Another last word, we don't like and use appimage, flatpack or snap.... on this distributions.

**Linux Packaging Prefered Formats** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/linux-packaging-prefered-formats/Python books) on the subject.
