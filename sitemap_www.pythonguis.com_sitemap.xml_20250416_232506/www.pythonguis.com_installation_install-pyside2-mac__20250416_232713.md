# Install PySide2 on macOS
Install PySide2 on macOS
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Feb 05 PySide2 [ Installation Guides ](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/)
This tutorial is also available for [PyQt6](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt6-mac/) , [PyQt5](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt5-mac/) , [PySide6](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside6-mac/) and [Tkinter](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-tkinter-mac/)
Before you start [the PySide2 tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyside2-tutorial/) you will need to have a working installation of PySide2 on your system. If you don't have either set up yet, the following steps will guide you through how to do this on macOS.
This guide is also available for [Linux](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside2-linux/) and [Windows](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside2-windows/).
## Install PySide2 on macOS
If you already have a working installation of Python 3 on macOS, you can go ahead and install PySide2 as for any other Python package, using the following --
bash ```
pip3 install pyside2

```

If you _don't_ have an installation of Python 3, you will need to install one first. You can download macOS installers for Python 3 from the [Python homepage](https://www.python.org/). Once installed, you should be able to use the `pip3 install` command above to install PySide2.
Another alternative is to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Homebrew is a package manager for command-line software on macOS. Homebrew has both Python 3 and PySide2 available in their repositories.

With Python installed, you can then install PySide2 as normal, using `pip3 install pyside2`, or alternatively choose to install it using Homebrew with --
bash ```
brew install pyside2

```

**Install PySide2 on macOS** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside2-mac/Python books) on the subject.
