# How can you pass additional args to a worker function?
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

How to pass the additional `args` and `kwargs` in `execute_this_fn` below is my code
python ```
worker = Worker(lambda :self.execute_this_fn(arg1, arg2, kwarg1)

```

I am getting
python ```
TypeError: <lambda>() got an unexpected keyword argument 'progress_callback'

```

Have u got a chance to figured this out? I have the same problem.
Because I have an error when I'm passing parameters to function like this:
python ```
worker = Worker(self.execute_this_fn, param1, param2)

```

Error is:

Hi, i have experimented quite a lot with the classes and QThreadPool concepts in this tutorial. By far the best i could find on the topic!.
In your slot function, you must add a `**kwargs` whether you plan to emit the signal or not, because the `progress_callback` is added as a keyword argument automatically in the Worker `__init__`
Check it out:
python ```
class Worker(QRunnable):
...
def **init** (self,
self.kwargs['progress_callback'] = self.signals.progress

```

Sorry coming late to this party but here's what I found works (so far):
change `execute_this_fn` signature:

python ```
def exec_this_fn(self, progress_callback, start=0):
for n in range(start, 5):

```

Then in the `oh_no` function, change worker initiation to
python ```
worker = Worker(self.execute_this_fn, start=2)

```

In this trivial example, the "start" parameter lets me start the count from 2 rather than 0.
Hope this helps.

Thank you for your reply, Your answer was much helpful, I am facing new problem please can you help me? I have pyqtgraph window inside my QDialog, i am calling the QDialog from my mainwindow application (through **Worker** thread), some times the QDialog runs proprely, some times the whole GUI is crashes with out giving any error message. If i wont run the QDialog from Worker thread the QDialog will freeze until the task in completed.
My final intention is to run the sub window (QDialog) in thread, with out being freeze.
