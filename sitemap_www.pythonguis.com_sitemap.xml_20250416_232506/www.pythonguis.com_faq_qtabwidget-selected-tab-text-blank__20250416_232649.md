# QTabWidget selected tab text blank
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
Mr_S_J_Childerley | 2021-01-06 18:58:45 UTC | #1
I've used QTabWidget successfully on windows 10 in the past without an issue. However using on a mac running macOS 11.0.1 I am seeing the text of the selected tab, when it has focus, being blanked out. ![QTabWidget_Selected|412x78](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/faq/forum/qtabwidget-selected-tab-text-blank/2tCciWfA7bEyAKNodWwJuzKUXZk.png)
The tab text (gets unblanked) only appears when the tab looses focus: ![QTabWidget_de_Selected|414x70](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/faq/forum/qtabwidget-selected-tab-text-blank/7n8p0XPKWAwdfMsD3nceHYPM2Xb.png)
I suspect there is perhaps a style setting to fix this. However I would have expected the default to do sensible things.
Any ideas?

Hey there! I've made a little test application and ran it on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and the tabs appear to be working correctly there.
python ```
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QTabWidget, QApplication, QWidget
app = QApplication([])
tab = QTabWidget()
w = QWidget()
tab.addTab(w, 'Hello')
w = QWidget()
tab.addTab(w, 'Test')
w = QWidget()
tab.addTab(w, 'Another')
tab.show()
app.exec_()

```

...which shows the following (tested dark mode also) --

Can you try this test to rule out any issues specific to your application? If this example doesn't work I can try upgrading one of my machines to 11.0 myself. Or perhaps you can try PyQt5 5.15.2 (latest) ?
Mr_S_J_Childerley | 2021-01-06 21:01:50 UTC | #3
Thanks Martin, with your example I got the same. ![Martins_example|502x344](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/faq/forum/qtabwidget-selected-tab-text-blank/cgwFrnOLHWzeT9Ec0RVE76Gfs6E.png) I'll try/attempt the upgrade to PyQt5 5.15.2

Slightly against my better judgement I pip installed PyQt5 5.15.2 into the failing conda environment. ![Martin_example_5.15.2|610x458](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/faq/forum/qtabwidget-selected-tab-text-blank/udSH9apaC7gqPfcDXz8NXNdRX7X.png) Which fixed the issue. Not intending to make an installable version for a while, when I might regret this!

Ah great, glad that's fixed it -- I wasn't looking forward to upgrading my mac! :slight_smile:
I've leave a note that you've done this in your `requirements.txt` / docs or similar, so you don't forget when you come to build. Easy to lose hours on forgotten quick fixes!
