This tutorial is also available for [PyQt6](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt6-linux/) , [PySide2](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside2-linux/) , [PySide6](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside6-linux/) and [PyQt5](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt5-linux/)
Before you start [the Tkinter tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/tkinter/), you need a working installation on your system. This short tutorial provides the steps to install Tkinter on Ubuntu Linux.
This guide is also available for [macOS](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-tkinter-mac/). On Windows, Tkinter is installed by default with Python.

## Install Tkinter on Ubuntu Using `apt`
In Ubuntu, you'll note that the Tkinter library isn't installed in the default distribution. We can install Tkinter either from the command line with the `apt` command or via the Software Center. The package we are looking for is `python3-tk`.
Best practices in Python recommend using [virtual environments](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/python-virtual-environments/) instead of installing packages directly into the system Python installation. The command shown below installs Tkinter in your system Python.
To install Tkinter from the command line, execute the following commands:
bash ```
$ sudo apt update 
$ sudo apt install python3-tk

```

The first command updates the package information from all sources of software we are using in our Ubutu system. The second command downloads and installs Tkinter.
After the installation is finished, you can start a Python interactive session and import the `tkinter` package as shown below:
