# Issue exporting data with Pycharm
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

Hi Martin.
Even I don't plan to use a QWebView, I have done the [MoosAche tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/examples/mooseache/). I have found it very interesting and instructive as indeed all the tutorials of LearnPyqt. Great idea. 
I'm running in Linux, Manjaro, Desktop environment Cinnamon with the last Python and Qt version i.e 3.82 and 5.14.2
However, I run into an issue when I run it in Pycharm, in a console or even in QtCreator. This behavior comes when I want to save a page with the corresponding function (save page). Here the corresponding code : 
python ```
  def save_file(self):
  filename, _ = QFileDialog.getSaveFileName(self, "Save Page as", "", "Hypertext Markup Languague (*.htm *.html);;" "Allfiles (*.*)")
  if filename:
    html = self.browser.page().toHtml()
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
      file.write(html)

```

I get this error : 
`Python 3.8.2 (default, Apr 8 2020, 14:31:25)  Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information IPython 7.14.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/issue-exporting-data-with-pycharm/Python books) on the subject.
