# Using fbs for packaging while creating the GUI with Qt Designer?
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Jan 12 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
David_Boutelier | 2020-05-11 10:52:25 UTC | #1
Great tutorial. I will definitely check the book. Do you have examples of using fbs for packaging while creating the GUI with designer and loading with `loadUiType`?
Thanks

I'm also interested in this.
I did just create the coolest thing which loops through the uic file loads the object and recreates the missing stuff objects as self.[name] the nice name for reuse as i was having trouble connection stuff to the slots before from my original code but now it all works and i figured id share this as normally i'd have to manually find each child object and manually call it like
`# self.controlpaneldropdown = self.findChild(QtWidgets.QComboBox, 'controlpaneldropdown') # Find the button`
[Packaging Python Applications with PyInstaller](https://www.pythonguis.com/packaging-book/) _by Martin Fitzpatrick_ â€” This step-by-step guide walks you through packaging your own Python applications from simple examples to complete installers and signed executables. 
[More info ](https://www.pythonguis.com/packaging-book/) [Get the book](https://secure.pythonguis.com/01hf77hrbf5v8z5kjtwbhmbwjz/)
After seeing this cool article i knew there had to be a way to load them all on the fly vs having to keep adding them one by one. I cannot believe nobody has done this before at least that I could find. https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2018/05/30/loading-ui-files-in-qt-for-python/
Now i can literally use QT Designer to design edit it live and all the signals an slots i added below the loop work and I can edit visually add new stuff and rapidly protoype without breaking the layout.
I'm going to create a new fbs app and try to splice this approach in and then ill report back i already and pretty far along my existing FBS app so not sure how well its going to go as i gotta feed this into the application context which is going to be even trickier but it seems like it should be possible.
python ```
from PyQt5 import uic, QtWidgets
import sys
from PyQt5.QtCore import QObject
qtCreatorFile = "mainwindow.ui" # Type your file path
Ui_MainWindow, QtBaseClass = uic.loadUiType(qtCreatorFile)

class build(Ui_MainWindow, QtWidgets.QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
    QtWidgets.QMainWindow.__init__(self)
    Ui_MainWindow.__init__(self)
    self.setupUi(self)
    for name, obj in dict(self.__dict__).items():
      # print(str(name) + str(obj))
      obj_type = str(obj).strip("<PyQt5").rsplit(" ")[0].replace(".", '', 1)
      # obj_type = str(obj).strip("<").rsplit(" ")[0]
      # print(obj_type)
      # obj_type = obj_str.strip("<PyQt5").rsplit(" ")[0].replace(".", '', 1)
      label_name = "self." + str(name)
      try:
        label_name = self.findChild(eval(obj_type), name)
        print(str(label_name) + ' created')
      except:
        pass
      if not isinstance(obj_type, QObject):
        continue

def start():
  app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
  bld = build()
  bld.show()
  sys.exit(app.exec_())

if __name__ == '__main__':
  start()

```

@David_Boutelier @martin I was able to get this working now and here is minimal example of how i did it. Hopefully this is helpful for other people this should be the default way to develop so fast now to prototype and test new widgets along with actual functionality.
The code stub. I tried to take as much out as possible but leave enough in for reference.

You can tell if its working when you fire up the app via fbs or manually cause you will see all the objects being created which means you can then interact and connect and work with them despite not having defined them individually via find child etc. So only need to put the logic not in the xml in the spot after my example.
In my case you can see all the tons of objects being created.

I can have Pycharm open for adding code and running fbs and use QT Designer to live edit and rerun now. This is gamechanging. If i had been able to do this when first learning python i would have saved months of time. This is why im sharing to hopefully save some other people all that frustration.

Hi @mike2750 thanks for this!
The loops there are just for debugging, correct?
Using `pyuic5` to generate a py file is fine -- you can import it and subclass from it to create a window and modify it. The problem just comes when you edit that generated file -- if you go back and change anything in your UI you're now stuck.
There are some examples of it [in the PyQt5 documentatation](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/designer.html) -- I should update the book/tutorials with some more examples of this, easy to get stuck.
Nothing quicker than using the .ui file directly though!
mike2750 | 2020-06-12 16:37:37 UTC | #5
I probably explained it wrong. Some more context. https://nitratine.net/blog/post/how-to-import-a-pyqt5-ui-file-in-a-python-gui/ https://codeloop.org/how-to-load-qt-designer-ui-file-in-pyqt5/
basically I'm using the ui file which i can edit via QT designer and then use directly for the UI without converting it to python .py file first.
The loop is there to show the objects are dynamically loaded in the real app and usable without converting it to raw python code first. It's importing the .ui file everytime the main.py is run.
I can edit the mainwindow.ui file in designer press save Then reload the main.py file to test which loads the updated .ui file and populates all the GUI into an object and that is then used in appcontext or MainWindow object. This means i don't have to convert the .ui file via pyuic5 to python every time i make a change and then run it which is a real pita. This leaves all the logic for the UI editable via the QT Designer and only the CLI python code and logic in that same main file.
Hopefully that makes more sense.
It works with FBS too now. So when i want to really change the overall look of the app i can leave all that GUI in the .ui file vs having to splice in the new widgets by hand each time in the correct nested order. If you want to see a side by side for reference feel free to shoot me a mail @martin to my email on profile be happy to provide that.
mike2750 | 2020-06-12 20:16:22 UTC | #6
Well apparently this is embarrassing, my example works but the loop part actually was not needed as you accurately observed. Now i see what the confusion was about. sorry about that. Been a long weekend... lol
I commented it out and stuff still seems to work without issues. So i guess when i overhauled the code and converted it all to use the .ui file whatever i thought that fixed must have gotten fixed in the process.
So short answer is yes you can totally do this from the .ui file but that loop i had in the first example isn't needed. Give this a try. I also had no problems freezing or releasing it just make sure your copy the .ui file into the here so its not missing in frozen version src/main/resources/base/mainwindow.ui

Ha, nice! Yeah, it's a great way to develop the UI -- makes it much easier to make iterative changes and see the effects.
Your post put an idea in my head, so I thought I'd follow through on it -- can you dynamically replace the UI while the app is running? And, yes you can! Sort of.
python ```
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMainWindow, QApplication, QAction, QToolBar
from PyQt5.QtCore import QObject, Qt
from PyQt5 import uic
import sys
qtCreatorFile = "untitled.ui" # Type your file path

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.reload = None
    self.load_ui()
  def load_ui(self):
    print("loading ui")
    cls, baseclass = uic.loadUiType(qtCreatorFile)
    class Window(cls, baseclass):
      pass
    self.ui = Window()
    self.ui.setupUi(self.ui)
    # Move the central widget from the loaded UI main window our visible one.
    self.setCentralWidget(self.ui.centralWidget())
    if not self.reload:
      menu = self.menuBar()
      ui = menu.addMenu("UI")
      self.reload = QAction("Reload UI")
      self.reload.triggered.connect(self.load_ui)
      self.reload.setShortcut(Qt.CTRL + Qt.Key_R) # You can reload with Ctrl-R
      ui.addAction(self.reload)

app = QApplication([])
w = MainWindow()
w.show()
app.exec_()

```

The trick here is to create an instance of a `QMainWindow` from the UI file, but then copy it's central widget (which contains the the entire window UI) out onto your already active window. You'd could do something like this for the menus too.
This puts the actual UI under the `self.ui` object, this is actually the _other_ `QMainWindow` instance(!) but it doesn't matter.
I wouldn't recommend this, but it was fun to try :D

that's pretty amazing @martin :slight_smile:
I also came up with this gem for fbs based packaging to generate the app icons which with some more looping and slight adjustments for mac i bet would make for a nice tutorial or content

```

Was using this and ended up making it work to now generate them all in the proper folders
Recommended path: src/main/icons/icongenerator.py
Also submitted the idea upstream cause this would be great if it was built in. https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs/issues/199

Its been awhile since i posted but after helping many friends and others and working on more prototype ideas i realized a better template/skeleton was needed that bootstraps all this stuff for both fbs and better repo management.
I made this over weekend for rapidly prototyping Python gui apps from two of my favorite projects [fbs](https://build-system.fman.io/) and [poetry](https://github.com/pawamoy/copier-poetry). Figured I'd share in case anyone here ever finds it useful. https://gitlab.com/mikeramsey/copier-poetry-fbs
I also left your site a shoutout @martin :heart:

This is really nice @mike2750 thanks for posting! I'd not come across copier before, but it looks perfect for something I've been thinking about -- project templates for common PyQt application structures.

My pleasure and yeah it is pretty amazing and having poetry makes pinning external resources and dependencies easy as hell.
I forgot to link the copier main page: https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

**Using fbs for packaging while creating the GUI with Qt Designer?** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/using-fbs-for-packaging-while-creating-the-gui-with-qt-designer/Python books) on the subject.
