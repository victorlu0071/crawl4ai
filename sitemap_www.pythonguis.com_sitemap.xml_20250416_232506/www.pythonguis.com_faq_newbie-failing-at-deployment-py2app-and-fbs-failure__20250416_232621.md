# Newbie Failing at deployment: py2app (and fbs) failure!
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
SAMBERPE10683 | 2021-04-09 17:57:30 UTC | #1
Hi Guys!
Can someone recommend the easiest way to deploy a pyqt program on a mac? I _thought_ that py2app was the way to go but have spent the last two days failing. I stripped out ALL my code to the barest of bones (see below) but although it runs in Alias mode and seems to build a "redistributable" OK. It consistently crashes (program has "quit unexpectedly"). See below.
All my code does is load a ui function & displays it (and YES, I did remember to add the ui file to the setup.py file before running "python setup.py py2app".
Could it be that maybe my fancy (sorta) new-ish M1 ARM Macbook Air is causing the trouble? Do I need to force Rosetta emulation? I'm using py2app 0.23. Mac OS 11.2.3 Big Sur Python 3.8.8
I must say that it is VERY frustrating to get your program working and NOT being able to deliver it! I'm going to try with python 3.7, 3.6, & 3.5 before trying fbs again and then..... I may have to give up on python GUI stuff (and go back to Matlab) if I can't deploy.
I apologize since this isn't really about pyqt but I'm a desperate man.

OK.... Never mind! I _THINK_ I got it working. The problem apparently had something to do with anaconda. I created a virtual environment with "python -m venv DanEnv", pip installed everything, and ran all the usual py2app commands and it appears to run OK (at least on my Mac).

Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/newbie-failing-at-deployment-py2app-and-fbs-failure/Python books) on the subject.
