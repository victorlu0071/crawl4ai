# .parent() vs. parent class in PowerBar example
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

I don't understand how the class `_Bar` can get access to the `QDial()` object defined in the `PowerBar`class by using `self.parent()`. Shouldn't `self.parent()`be referring to `QWidget`, the class it is inheriting from?

Nevermind! Turns out `parent()` in Qt has different relationship then superclass to subclass. Instead it is between object instances, and when `_Bar` is instantiated within `PowerBar`, the `parent()` of `_Bar` refers to the `Powerbar` class.
