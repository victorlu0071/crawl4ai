#  PySide2 Tutorial 
##  The _complete_ PySide2 tutorial — Create GUI applications with Python 
### The easy way to create desktop applications
Last updated 4 April 2025
![Create Desktop GUI Applications with PySide2](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/courses/pyside.svg)
PySide, also known as _Qt for Python_ , is a Python library for creating GUI applications using the Qt toolkit. PySide is the _official_ binding for Qt on Python and is now developed by _The Qt Company_ itself.
This complete PySide2 tutorial takes you from first concepts to building fully-functional GUI applications in Python. It requires some basic Python knowledge, but no previous familiarity with GUI concepts. Everything will be introduced step by by step, using hands-on examples.
There are two major versions currently in use: [PySide2 based on Qt5](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyside2-tutorial/) and [PySide6 based on Qt6](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyside6-tutorial/). Both versions are almost completely compatible aside from imports, and lack of support for some advanced modules in Qt6. PyQt6 also makes some changes to how namespaces and flags work, but these are easily manageable.
PySide2 is the Qt5-based edition of the Python GUI library PySide from The Qt Company.
_Looking for something else? I also have a[PyQt5 tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt5-tutorial/), [PyQt6 tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt6-tutorial/) and [PySide6 tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyside6-tutorial/)._
This track consists of _28 tutorials_. Keep checking back as I'm adding new tutorials regularly — last updated 4 April 2025. 
![Getting started with PySide](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/courses/helloworld_JeRwi1P.jpg)
## Getting started with PySide
### Take your first steps building Python & Qt5 apps with PySide
Like writing any code, building PySide applications is all about approaching it in the right way. In the first part of the course we cover the fundamentals necessary to get you building Python GUIs as quickly as possible. By the end of the first part you'll have a running `QApplication` which we can then customize.

![Creating applications with Qt Designer](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/courses/qt/designer.png)
## Creating applications with Qt Designer
### Using the drag-drop designer to develop your PySide apps
As your applications get larger or interfaces become more complicated, it can get a bit cumbersome to define all elements programmatically. The good news is that Qt comes with a graphical editor Qt Designer (or Qt Creator) which contains a drag-and-drop UI editor — Qt Designer. In this PySide tutorial we'll cover the basics of creating Python GUIs with Qt Designer.

![Threads & Processes](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/courses/qt/concurrent.png)
## Threads & Processes
### Run concurrent tasks without impacting your PySide UI
As your applications become more complex you may finding yourself wanting to perform long-running tasks, such as interacting with remote APIs or performing complex calculations. By default any code you write exists in the same thread and process, meaning your long-running code can actually block Qt execution and cause your Python GUI app to "hang". In this PySide tutorial we'll cover how to avoid this happening and keep your applications running smoothly, no matter the workload.

![ModelViews and Databases](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/courses/qt/modelviews.png)
## ModelViews and Databases
### Connecting your PySide application to data sources
All but the simplest of apps will usually need to interact with some kind of external data store — whether that's a database, a remote API or simple configuration data. The Qt ModelView architecture simplifies the linking and updating your UI with data in custom formats or from external sources. In this PySide tutorial we'll discover how you can use Qt ModelViews to build high performance Python GUIs.

![Graphics and Plotting](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/courses/qt/plotting.png)
## Graphics and Plotting
### Vector graphics and plotting using PyQtGraph in PySide
Python is one of the most popular languages in the data science and machine learning fields. Effective visualization of data is a key part of building usable interfaces for data science. Matplotlib is the most popular plotting library in Python, and comes with support for PyQt built in. In addition, there are PyQt-specific plotting options available such as PyQtGraph which provide a better interactive experience. In this tutorial we'll look at these alternatives and build some simple plot interfaces.

![QGraphics Framework](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/courses/qgraphics.png)
## QGraphics Framework
### Vector graphic interfaces in PySide2
The PySide2 Graphics View framework is a scene-based vector graphics API. Using this you can create dynamic interactive interfaces for anything from vector graphics tools, data analysis workflow designers to simple 2D games. The Graphics View Framework allows you to develop fast & efficient scenes, containing millions of items, each with their own distinct graphic features and behaviors.

![Custom Widgets](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/courses/qt/custom-widgets.png)
## Custom Widgets
### Designing your own custom widgets in PySide
Widgets in Qt are built on bitmap graphics — drawing pixels on a rectangular canvas to construct the "widget". To be able to create your own custom widgets you first need to understand how the `QPainter` system works and what you can do with it. In this PySide tutorial we'll go from basic bitmap graphics to our own entirely custom widget.

## Packaging and distribution
### Sharing your PySide applications with other people
There comes a point in any app's development where it needs to leave home — half the fun in writing software is being able to share it with other people. Packaging Python GUI apps can be a little tricky, but in this PySide tutorial we'll cover how to package up your apps to share, whether commercially or just for fun.

## QtQuick & QML in PySide2
### Building modern PySide2 GUIs with QtQuick & QML
Qt Quick is Qt's declarative UI design system, using the Qt Modeling Language (QML) to define custom user interfaces. Originally developed for use in mobile applications, it offers dynamic graphical elements and fluid transitions and effects allowing you to replicate the kinds of UIs you find on mobile devices. Qt Quick is supported on all desktop platforms too and is a great choice for building desktop widgets or other interactive tools. Qt Quick is also a great choice for developing UIs for hardware and microcontrollers with PySide2.
