# Why is the Qt Creator used in the tutorial?
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
doev | 2020-07-21 16:10:50 UTC | #1
Is there any advantage by using the Qt Creator instead of the Qt Designer?
martin | 2020-07-23 12:51:30 UTC | #2
Hey @doev good question -- and the short answer is, not really.
Qt Creator is the complete IDE for Qt, which is made up of a number of separate tools (including Qt Designer) along with some project management functionality. The Qt Designer component of Qt Creator is identical to the standalone Qt Designer with a few very small exceptions (where you're working with project managed resources for example). So you should be able to follow the instructions the same no matter which you have.
I _think_ I wrote the tutorial in Qt Creator originally simply because that's what I was using at the time. I plan to update that tutorial to describe Qt Designer instead (to avoid the confusion) and split out the "What is the difference?" explanation to a separate article.

Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/why-is-the-qt-creator-used-in-the-tutorial/Python books) on the subject.
