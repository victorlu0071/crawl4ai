# Install PyQt5 on Ubuntu Linux
Install PyQt5 on Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Apr 08 PyQt5 [ Installation Guides ](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/)
This tutorial is also available for [PyQt6](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt6-linux/) , [PySide2](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside2-linux/) , [PySide6](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside6-linux/) and [Tkinter](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-tkinter-linux/)
Before you start creating GUI applications with [PyQt5](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt5-tutorial/), you need to have a working installation of PyQt5 on your system. In this short tutorial, you'll find the steps that will guide you through installing PyQt5 on Ubuntu Linux.
This guide is also available for [macOS](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt5-mac/) and [Windows](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt5-windows/).
Note that the following instructions are for installing the PyQt5 version registered under the _GPL license_. If you need to use PyQt in a non-GPL project, then you will need to purchase an alternative license from [Riverbank Computing](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com) to release your software.

## Preparing Ubuntu to Install PyQt5
Before installing PyQt5, we need to prepare our operating system and install a couple of tools. Python best practices recommend using [virtual environments](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/python-virtual-environments/) to isolate our Python projects and manage their dependencies.
Unfortunately, the default Ubuntu installation doesn't include tools like the `venv` module, which allows us to create virtual environments, and the `pip` command, which lets us install external packages. So, we need to install them from the distro's repositories.
### Installing the `venv` and `pip`
To install the `venv` module and the `pip` command in Ubuntu, we can run the following commands:
bash ```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip

```

The first command updates the package information from all sources of software we are using in our Ubutu system. The second command downloads and installs the `venv` module and the `pip` command. Now, we are ready to create and activate a Python virtual environment.

[Book Now](https://www.pythonguis.com/live/) [60 mins ($195)](https://cal.com/mfitzp/60min-python-guis-coaching/)
### Creating a Virtual Environment
Once we've installed the `venv` module, we can proceed to create and activate a Python virtual environment:
bash ```
$ mkdir project/ && cd project/
$ python3 -m venv ./venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $

```

First, we create a new working directory named `project/` as a root for a hypothetical PyQt5 project. Then, we create a new virtual environment with `venv` and activate it. Note how the prompt indicator changes to signal that we're in an active virtual environment.
## Install PyQt5 in a Virtual Environment With `pip`
Once we've created and activated our virtual environment, we can install PyQt5 with the following command:
bash ```
(venv) $ pip3 install pyqt5

```

This command downloads PyQt5 from the [Python package index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) and installs it in our virtual environment.
## Install PyQt5 System-wise Using `apt`
Sometimes, we may need to install PyQt5 in the operating system rather than in a virtual environment. In Ubuntu's repositories, we'll find packages for PyQt5, although they may be out of date. Check first to ensure you're getting a version that meets your requirements, and if not, use the `pip` method above.

In Ubuntu, we can install either from the command line with the `apt` command or via the Software Center. The package we are looking for is `python3-pyqt5`.
To install PyQt5 from the command line, execute the following command:
bash ```
$ sudo apt install python3-pyqt5

```

## Check the Installation
After the PyQt5 installation is finished, we can start a Python interactive session and import the library as shown below to test your installation:
python ```
>>> import PyQt5

```

If you're using the `pip` installation, make sure you are in the terminal session with the active virtual environment. If you are using the `apt` installation, you can import the library from any terminal session.
Now that you've completed the installation in your Ubuntu Linux system, you can start [creating Python GUI applications with PyQt5](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt5-tutorial/).
