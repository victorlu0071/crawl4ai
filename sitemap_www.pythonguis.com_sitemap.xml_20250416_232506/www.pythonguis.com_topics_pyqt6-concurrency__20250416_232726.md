# [ _Performance_ & Concurrency ](https://www.pythonguis.com/topics/pyqt6-concurrency/)
Building real applications, you'll find yourself wanting to perform long-running tasks. For example, your application might need to interact with remote APIs or perform complex calculations.
But you'll notice a problem: while the long-running task completes, your app will become unresponsive. Your code _blocks Qt from running_ until it returns.
In these tutorials we'll discover how to use **threads & processes** to long-running tasks while keeping your app responsive.
  * Learn how to [execute long-running tasks using a thread pool](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/multithreading-pyqt6-applications-qthreadpool/) and send and receive data
  * Execute [external programs in another process](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt6-qprocess-external-programs/) and communicate with them with streams
