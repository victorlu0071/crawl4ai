# PySide6: Is the QWebEngineView available?
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

I've seen conflicting information about using the QWebEngineView in PySide6. I'd like to convert my pyqt5 project to pyside6, but need the WebEngineView. Is it available now?
If not, would converting to pyside2 now make the transition to pyside6 easier when it is available?

Since Qt will add back QtWebEngine and QtWebView in Qt 6.2, I guess you'll have to wait 'till September 2021 for PyQt6/PySide6 to have those modules available.
