# AttributeError module 'time' has no attribute 'clock'
Using PyQtGraph with Python 3.8
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Jul 23 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
PyQtGraph is a library for [creating plots in PyQt applications](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/plotting-pyqtgraph/). Recent changes in Python 3.8 can cause problems if you're using older versions of PyQtGraph.
> I got an error when running your plotting script above at line `from pyqtgraph import PlotWidget, plot`, which gave the error `Exception has occurred: AttributeError module 'time' has no attribute 'clock'`
The `clock` member was removed from the `time` module in [Python 3.8](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#api-and-feature-removals). In your own code this can be replaced with either `time.perf_counter()` or `time.process_time()` instead, depending on your requirements. For libraries such as PyQtGraph you'll need to wait for them to be updated.
This was fixed in PyQtGraph [v0.11.0rc0](https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph/issues/1077) and is available via PyPi.
In future, if you need to access the latest versions of PyQtGraph before release, you can also install the current master from Github directly.
python ```
pip install git+https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph.git

```

Alternatively, you can downgrade to Python 3.7 in the meantime.
