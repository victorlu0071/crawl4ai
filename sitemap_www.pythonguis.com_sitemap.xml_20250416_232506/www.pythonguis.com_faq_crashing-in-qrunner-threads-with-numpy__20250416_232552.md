# Crashing in QRunner threads with numpy

Thanks for the great write-up. I'm attempting to use this example to stream a live video feed (`numpy` array -> `QImage` -> `QPixmap` -> `QLabel` inside a `QScrollArea`) but I am frequently encountering crashes when the label is resized too quickly, or the scroll area is scrolled too quickly. I have seen people mention that it could be a problem with `QImage` memory buffer getting cleared before the `QPixmap` can update the `QPainter` event, but I tried storing a `.copy()` of the `QImage` and that didn't work.
Is this something you think can be fixed, or does it sound like a fundamental issue with the way threads work with Python/PyQt5?

Well only about 30 minutes later, I was able to implement a new signal (`bool`, 'result' signal) that gets emitted when the `QImage` is converted. I also moved the `setPixmap` event to a separate function that only runs when the 'result' signal is emitted and now I haven't experienced any crashes. Thanks so much for your tutorials - I just bought the book!

Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/crashing-in-qrunner-threads-with-numpy/Python books) on the subject.
