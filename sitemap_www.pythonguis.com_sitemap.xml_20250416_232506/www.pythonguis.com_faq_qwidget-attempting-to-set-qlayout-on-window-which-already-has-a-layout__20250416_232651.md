# QWidget::setLayout: Attempting to set QLayout "" on Window "", which already has a layout
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
I am a Beginner. I do not understand this error message. Who can explain it to me. :-)
> Attempting to set QLayout "" on Window "", which already has a layout
python ```
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import (
  QApplication, QWidget, QMainWindow,
  QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout, QFormLayout, QGridLayout, QStackedLayout,
  QPushButton, QComboBox, QLineEdit, QCheckBox, QRadioButton,
)
class Window(QWidget):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    layVer = QVBoxLayout()
    self.comBox = QComboBox()
    self.comBox.addItems(["One", "Two", "Three"])
    self.comBox.activated.connect(lambda x: self.onComBox(x))
    layVer.addWidget(self.comBox)
    self.setLayout(layVer)
    layHor = QHBoxLayout()
    self.cheBox1 = QCheckBox("A")
    layHor.addWidget(self.cheBox1)
    self.setLayout(layHor)
    layVer.addLayout(layHor)
  def onCheBox(self, s):
    print(s)
  def onComBox(self, s):
    print(s, self.comBox.currentText())
if __name__ == "__main__":
  app = QApplication([])
  win = Window()
  win.show()
  app.exec_()

```

_PedanticHacker_
Firstly, delete the line `self.setLayout(layVer)`
then fix
python ```
self.setLayout(layHor)
layVer.addLayout(layHor)

```

to be
python ```
layVer.addLayout(layHor)
self.setLayout(layVer)

```

This error occurs because you're trying to set a layout on a `QMainWindow`. The `QMainWindow` is a special widget which has a built-in layout, to handle things link menus, toolbars and dock widgets.
For windows based on `QMainWindow` you can only set a _central widget_ -- that is, the widget that appears in the center of the window. But if you remember from the [PyQt5 layouts tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt-layouts/) you can set a layout on an empty `QWidget` and add anything you want to it that way.
So the trick is: for controlling the layout of a mainwindow we first create a `QWidget` to act as a "container", use that widget as our _central widget_ and apply the layout to it to add other widgets.

Merci now it works!
