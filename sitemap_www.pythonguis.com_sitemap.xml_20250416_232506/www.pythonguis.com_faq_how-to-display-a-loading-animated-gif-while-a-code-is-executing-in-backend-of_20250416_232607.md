# How to display a loading animated gif while a code is executing in backend of my Python Qt5 UI?
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Nov 04 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

**Environment:**
Python 3.7
Qt5
Windows 10
**Problem:**
When I execute my code, it shows immediately the UI, then it supposes to make some other preparing stuff and display a loading gif while these initialization tasks are running. But it does work. Instead of showing the gif, the UI is blocked(froze) waiting for my preparing script to finish its job. 
[PyQt/PySide 1:1 Coaching with Martin Fitzpatrick](https://cal.com/mfitzp/60min-python-guis-coaching/) â€” Get one on one help with your Python GUI projects. Working together with you I'll identify issues and suggest fixes, from bugs and usability to architecture and maintainability. 
[Book Now](https://www.pythonguis.com/live/) [60 mins ($195)](https://cal.com/mfitzp/60min-python-guis-coaching/)
My script has a button to Run my main script "StartMyApp" and show an animated gif while MyApp is running without freezing my UI. I use multithread for this purpose. It works perfectly. I used this tutorial : <https://www.pythonguis.com/courses/concurrent-execution/multithreading-pyqt-applications-qthreadpool/>
So I thought by cloning the same logic, I could display another loading gif at the **init** of my UI but it didn't work. I missed something. I don't understand because the "Run" button works perfectly by showing the gif and running the main code without freezing the UI whereas my "preparing" code is not showing the gif and freezing my UI until it finishes.
Does anyone understand the source of this issue?

Hi,
I have not tested your application but just looking your code, I note something who seems to be wrong (perhaps an typo error ?) for me.
python ```
class Ui(QtWidgets.QMainWindow):
def __init__(self):
  super(Ui, self).__init__()
  uic.loadUi('Ui/MyAppUI.Ui', self)
  # === We display the UI ==========
  self.show()

```

it would not be ('Ui/MyAppUI.ui', self) by chance ?
