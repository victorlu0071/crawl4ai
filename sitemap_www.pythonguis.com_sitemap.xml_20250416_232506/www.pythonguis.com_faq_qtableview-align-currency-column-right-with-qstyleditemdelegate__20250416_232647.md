# QTableView Align Currency Column Right with QStyledItemDelegate
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

How can I align the currency value in a column? QAbstractTableModel.data() just has strings to return so I get an error trying to .setAlignment() there. The delegate has no 'role' parm to align for display. The createEditor works ok with the QLineEdit().setAlignment(Qt.AlignRight).
Do I need to implement paint() for display of text?

Maybe [THIS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47971275/how-to-align-the-text-to-center-of-cells-in-a-qtablewidget) will give you a hint.
Edward_Lipson | 2021-04-05 11:42:26 UTC | #3
I know that. If I use the QTableWidget (not my question here, I'm using QTableView/QAbstractTableModel with QStyledItemDelegate for editing) and set the QTableWidgetItem to the cell with setCellWidget, I can use the alignment of the QTableWidgetItem, along with a QValidator.

I'm trying to learn the Model/View concepts. I've got them working for what I need except for alignment.

Can you try using `setTextAlignment()` instead of `setAlignment()`?

I kept on searching, and of course it was right in front of me (in the Book!) - [Learpyqt qtableview modelview](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/qtableview-modelviews-numpy-pandas/). It is part of the model, data() function .... elif role == Qt.TextAlignmentRole: if index.column() in (amt_columns): return Qt.AlignRight
For some reason it does not work correctly if I return Qt.AlignRight | Qt.AlighVCenter
Edited: read further on the page and saw Qt.AlignVCenter + Qt.AlignRight But: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'PySide2.QtCore.Qt.AlignmentFlag' and 'PySide2.QtCore.Qt.AlignmentFlag'
