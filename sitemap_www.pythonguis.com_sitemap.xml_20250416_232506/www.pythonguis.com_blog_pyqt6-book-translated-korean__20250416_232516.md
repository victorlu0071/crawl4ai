# PyQt6 Book now available in Korean: 파이썬과 Qt6로 GUI 애플리케이션 만들기
The hands-on guide to creating GUI applications with Python gets a new translation
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 13 PyQt6 [ blog ](https://www.pythonguis.com/blog/)
I am very happy to announce that my Python GUI programming book **Create GUI Applications with Python & Qt6 / PyQt6 Edition** is now available in Korean from [Acorn Publishing](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/book/python-qt6)
It's more than a little mind-blowing to see a book I've written translated into another language -- not least one I cannot remotely understand! When I started writing this book a few years ago I could never have imagined it would end up on book shelves in Korea, never mind in Korean. This is just fantastic.

If you're in Korea, you can also pick up a copy at any of the following bookstores: [Kyobobook](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000201323866), [YES24](http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/118042593) or [Aladin](https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=313563300)
Thanks again to Acorn Publishing for translating my book and making it available to readers in Korea.
