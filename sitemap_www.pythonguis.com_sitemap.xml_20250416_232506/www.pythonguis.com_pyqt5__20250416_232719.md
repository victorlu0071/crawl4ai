# Create GUI Applications with PyQt5
## **Want to create Python GUIs?** Here is _everything_ you need to go from simple UIs to complete apps with PyQt5. 
Building GUI applications with Python doesn't have to be difficult. In this tutorial I'll walk you step by step from simple Python GUIs to real useful apps.
By the end of the tutorial you'll be able to make your own applications, design professional UIs and even create installers and packages to share your apps with other people.
PyQt5 is a Python GUI framework for making GUI applications using the Qt toolkit. Created by Riverbank Computing, the PyQt library is free software (GPL licensed) and has been in development since 1999. PyQt5 was released in 2016 and last updated in October 2021.
_This tutorial requires some basic Python knowledge, but no experience with GUI programming._
[](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt5/#start)
## [ Where do I _begin_ with PyQt5? ](https://www.pythonguis.com/topics/pyqt5-getting-started/)
Take your first steps creating Python GUI applications with these simple step-by-step guides to Python & Qt.
_PyQt5 not installed? See our installation guides for[Windows](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt-windows/), [macOS](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt-mac/), [Linux](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt-linux/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt5-raspberry-pi/)_
Once you're set up you can **get started** by [Creating your first GUI application with Python](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/creating-your-first-pyqt-window/).
[![Where do I begin with PyQt5?](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/tags/getting-started.png)](https://www.pythonguis.com/topics/pyqt5-getting-started/)
## [ Learn the _fundamentals_](https://www.pythonguis.com/topics/pyqt5-foundation/)
Now you have made your first GUI app, let's go a step further adding widgets and layouts to **build some simple Python UIs**.
  * Connect button presses to actions in your apps with [Signals, Slots & Events](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt-signals-slots-events/)
  * Take a look at [Widgets available in PyQt6](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt-basic-widgets/)
  * Arrange widgets together using [Layouts](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt-layouts/) to build real applications.
  * Add [toolbars & menus](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt-actions-toolbars-menus/) with keyboard shortcuts using QAction.
  * Popup [dialogs](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt-dialogs/) to get confirmation, or select files.
  * Build [multi-window applications](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/creating-multiple-windows/).


[![Learn the fundamentals of PyQt5](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/courses/pyqt.png)](https://www.pythonguis.com/topics/pyqt5-foundation/)
## [ Using Qt Designer with PyQt5 ](https://www.pythonguis.com/topics/pyqt5-qt-designer/)
So far we have been creating apps using Python code. This works well in many cases, but it can get a bit cumbersome to define all widgets programmatically. The good news is that **Qt comes with a graphical editor** — _Qt Designer_ — which contains a drag-and-drop UI editor. Using _Qt Designer_ you can define your UIs visually and then simply hook up the application logic later.
  * Take your [first steps with Qt Designer](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/first-steps-qt-creator/) & find out how to create UIs and use them in Python
  * Work through [how to lay out your UIs in Designer](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/qt-designer-gui-layout/) to get the hang of how Qt Designer works
  * Learn how to [create custom Dialogs with Designer](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/creating-dialogs-qt-designer/) and use them in your apps


If you're going to be distributing your applications, you might also want to take a look at [the QResource framework](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/qresource-system/) which simplifies bundling data files (like icons) with your applications.

## [ PyQt5 for Data Science ](https://www.pythonguis.com/topics/pyqt5-data-science/)
Most Python apps need to interact with data sources — whether that's a CSV file, database or remote APIs. One of the main benefits of using Python to build applications is being able to make use of Python's **data science tools** to process and analyse data.
With PyQt5 you can make use of Qt's model view architecture to display performant views of _any_ Python data in your applications. Or embed matplotlib and PyQtGraph plots for dynamic visualizations.
  * Use the [model view architecture](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/modelview-architecture/) to display dynamic data from any source
  * Display _numpy_ and _Pandas_ data frames as [spreadsheet tables in your PyQt5 applications](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/qtableview-modelviews-numpy-pandas/)
  * Use Matplotlib [to add interactive plots to your apps](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/plotting-matplotlib/)
  * Or take a look at PyQtGraph for [high performance graphs and other visualizations](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/plotting-pyqtgraph/)


_If you're using Qt Designer to create your applications, take a look at[how to use PyQtGraph & Matplotlib widgets inside Qt Designer](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt6-embed-pyqtgraph-custom-widgets-qt-app/)._

## [ _Performance_ & Concurrency ](https://www.pythonguis.com/topics/pyqt5-concurrency/)
Building real applications, you'll find yourself wanting to perform long-running tasks. For example, your application might need to interact with remote APIs or perform complex calculations.
But you'll notice a problem: while the long-running task completes, your app will become unresponsive. Your code _blocks Qt from running_ until it returns.
In these tutorials we'll discover how to use **threads & processes** to long-running tasks while keeping your app responsive.
  * Learn how to [execute long-running tasks using a thread pool](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/multithreading-pyqt-applications-qthreadpool/) and send and receive data
  * Execute [external programs in another process](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/qprocess-external-programs/) and communicate with them with streams

## [ Designing your _own Widgets_](https://www.pythonguis.com/topics/pyqt5-custom-widgets/)
Qt comes with a large library of widgets built-in. But sometimes your applications need something different. In PyQt5 you can you design your own widgets, drawing them directly in your application.
In these tutorials we'll go through the basics of drawing graphics in Qt to building your own entirely custom widget.
  * Learn about drawing [graphics bitmap primitives](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/bitmap-graphics/)
  * Assemble existing widgets to [create compound widgets](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/creating-your-own-custom-widgets/)
  * Add [animations and transitions to your widgets](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/qpropertyanimation/) to make them feel more tactile

There comes a point in any app's development where it needs to leave home — half the fun in writing software is being able to **share it with other people**. Packaging Python GUI apps can be a little tricky, but these guides will walk you through the process step by step.

PyQt5 has _two_ APIs for building GUIs. We've already introduced the Qt Widgets API which is well-suited for building desktop applications. Qt also provides a _declarative_ API in the form of Qt Quick/QML. Qt Quick is well suited for building modern touchscreen interfaces for microcontrollers or device interfaces.
