# Signal and Slot

Dear Martin, 
I am just done watching the [Signal, Slots & Events video](https://www.pythonguis.com/courses/start/signals-slots-events/) and done reading the `Signals and Slots` chapter on your PySide2 ebook. The sample code below is from your video
python ```
self.windowTitleChanged.connect(self.onWindowTitleChange)
def onWindowTitleChange(self, s):  # <--- "s" ??
  print(s)

```

How do you know that the signal is also passing along a string variable `s` in this case? There are so many type of signals in Qt (pressed, released, drag, move....etc), how do we know each signal is passing along **what-else** when it is triggered? How do we find out?
Thanks

You can find your answers here: https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/PySide2/QtGui/QWindow.html?highlight=windowtitlechanged#PySide2.QtGui.PySide2.QtGui.QWindow.windowTitleChanged
I think that in this case the signal emits only one unicode parameter.

Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/signal-and-slot/Python books) on the subject.
