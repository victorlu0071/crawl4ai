# Signals, Slots and Events: NameError: name 'QMainWindow' is not defined
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
Nigel_Trewartha | 2020-05-07 15:08:46 UTC | #1
I am using WIngIDE Pro version 7.2.2.2 on a WIn 10 64bit Pro. and am using the code under the "Signals. Slots and Events.
https://www.pythonguis.com/courses/start/signals-slots-events/#jc8dc3b580-deef-49f8-bf79-a2e67e6fa50a
I get this error;
python ```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "D:\Eigene Dateien\PYQT5_Sources\test4-signals and slots1.py", line 5, in <module>
class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
NameError: name 'QMainWindow' is not defined

```

Process terminated with an exit code of 1
I even changed to code to include this:
python ```
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
import PyQt5

```

So I appear to be doing something very wrong. Can I get help here please??

Hi Nigel, welcome to the site! 
This is because you don't have an import for `QMainWindow`. You can either import `QMainWindow` itself or you can import `QtWidgets` and access `QMainWindow` through there. 
python ```
class MainWindow(QtWidgets.QMainWindow):

```

or
python ```
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow

```

Will update this tutorial to include the full code to start with as this is very confusing.

Thany you for your reply. I copied your code. That does have a Mainwindow. Perhaps an idea to include this in your code.
I also cannot find "Load up a fresh copy of `MyApp_window.py` and save it under a new name for this section". I assume you mean one of the exercises in the last section..

I added the import `from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow`
But when I start the programme it seems to do nothing. Tried it under WingIDE pro and cmd -> python "filename"
Since I just copied and pasted your programme snippet and added `from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow` . I do not see what I am doing wrong.

[quote="Nigel_Trewartha, post:3, topic:32"] Perhaps an idea to include this in your code. [/quote]
I've added the base code to the top of the tutorial, should make it clearer -- thanks for the feedback!
