# RuntimeError: The current Numpy installation fails to pass a sanity check due to a bug in the windows runtime

Hello I tried to run the basic first example I get this error
python ```

I reinstalled numpy and pyqtgraph. Can you give me some ideas to resolve this issue

This is unfortunately a bug in Windows which will require a fix from Microsoft. The issue is affecting all numpy installations -- the bug is tracked on the link at the bottom. Further down that page you can see [this list of possible solutions](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/comments/1244066/view.html). These are --
  1. **Python in WSL** . This is a no go for PyQt5, as you can't expose WSL GUIs.
  2. **conda + MKL BLAS** using `conda create -n mkl python numpy`. Although this requires you to use conda.
  3. **conda + OpenBLAS 0.3.12** . (same really)
  4. **Use 1.19.3** Install with `pip install numpy==1.19.3`


The only option seems to be either [switching to conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html) for your Python packages, or downgrading to numpy. Note that it says on the link page that you can see encounter the issue on numpy 1.19.3 if you're using SciPy linear algebra routines.
Does that help at all?
Mark_Salerno | 2020-12-19 18:49:10 UTC | #3
Martin Yes that worked. I actually found the fix and went to post it and saw you just answered. I really appreciate the time that you take to fully explain the answers.
I first ran **pip uninstall numpy** then I ran **pip install numpy==1.19.3**

Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/runtimeerror-the-current-numpy-installation-fails-to-pass-a-sanity-check-due-to-a-bug-in-the-windows-runtime/Python books) on the subject.
