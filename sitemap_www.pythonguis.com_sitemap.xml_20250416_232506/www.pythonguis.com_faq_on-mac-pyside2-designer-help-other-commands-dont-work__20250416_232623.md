# On Mac, PySide2 Designer Help & other commands don't work
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PySide2 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

It looks like the PySide2 directory structure doesn't match what that version of Designer expects. So do follow the instructions in Chapter 13 in the book to install Qt and run Designer and all will be well. (Mostly, see "On Mac, don't move Designer to Applications".

Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/on-mac-pyside2-designer-help-other-commands-dont-work/Python books) on the subject.
