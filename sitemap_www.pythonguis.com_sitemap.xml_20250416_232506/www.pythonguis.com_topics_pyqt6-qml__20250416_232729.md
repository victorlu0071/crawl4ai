# [ QML/QtQuick applications with PyQt6 ](https://www.pythonguis.com/topics/pyqt6-qml/)
PyQt6 has _two_ APIs for building GUIs. We've already introduced the Qt Widgets API which is well-suited for building desktop applications. Qt also provides a _declarative_ API in the form of Qt Quick/QML. Qt Quick is well suited for building modern touchscreen interfaces for microcontrollers or device interfaces.
  * Get started building [your first QML/Qt Quick application](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt6-qml-qtquick-python-application/)
  * Learn about QML animations and transformations, by [building an analog desktop clock](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt6-qml-animations-transformations/)
