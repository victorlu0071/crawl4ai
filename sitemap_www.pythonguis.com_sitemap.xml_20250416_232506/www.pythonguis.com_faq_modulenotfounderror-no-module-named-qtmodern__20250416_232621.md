# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qtmodern'

Hi @martin, I was trying to run the sample code `themes\modern.py` but I get the following error:
python ```
import qtmodern.styles
import qtmodern.windows
...
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qtmodern'

```

I believe the file `qtmodern.py` is missing.
Best Regard

Yep, qtmodern is a separate library you need to install with pip. Just the normal `pip install qtmodern` should do it.
I'll check the explanation as maybe this isn't made clear enough.

Your ebook didn’t mentioned anything about the **qtmodern**. But the code is from your zip file, under the **theme** folder. Most of the code are related to that chapter, and I thought **qtmodern** Is a file. Now I know it is library. Thanks

The (small) bit about Qt modern is on page 199 under "3rd Party Styles" in the "16. Styles" chapter. There isn't any code shown in the book though.

Thanks @martin, I found it now, it's on page 184 on mine.
