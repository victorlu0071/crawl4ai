# ModelView Autoselection
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
Mohamad_Zakwan | 2020-05-07 18:29:29 UTC | #1
Anyone manage to get the autoselection working? I've been reading the document in qt official website, but could not find a direct explanation on how to do it. I manage to get auto-selection works, but it involves creating a QRect. I don't think that's the correct way.
Hank_Ericson | 2020-06-05 01:06:24 UTC | #2
Hi Mohamad,
You can get select by replacing the
python ```
self.todoView.clearSelection()

```

part with the following:
python ```
lastindex = self.model.index(len(self.model.todos)-1, 0)
self.todoView.setCurrentIndex(lastindex)

```

This will first get the last index as a QModelIndex from the model itself by specifying the last row (length - 1) and column 0 and then setting that index as the current index in the todoView.
