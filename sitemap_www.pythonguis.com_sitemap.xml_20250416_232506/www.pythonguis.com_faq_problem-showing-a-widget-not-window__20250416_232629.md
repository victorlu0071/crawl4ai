# Problem showing a widget (not Window)
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Nov 04 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

Hello Martin, I am currently facing a problem where I am trying to show-up a WIDGET not a WINDOW. For this I have a seaparate UI file say Ui.py. Now, in order to provide functionality to the GUI, I need to create a class, right? - I did. Now, I am not able to get the UI show-up please help me. I think I am missing the basics. Please find my code below.
python ```
import PySide2
import os
import sys
from smoky_UI import Ui_Form
from PySide2 import QtWidgets
dirname = os.path.dirname(PySide2.__file__)
plugin_path = os.path.join(dirname, 'plugins', 'platforms')
os.environ['QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH'] = plugin_path
class MyQtApp(Ui_Form,):
  def __int__ (self):
    super().__init__()
    self.setupUi(self)
if __name__ == '__main__':
  app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
  qt_app = MyQtApp()
  qt_app.show()
  sys.exit(app.exec_())

```
