# How to refresh a treeview?
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

I have a File Explorer panel (based on a tutorial) that uses a QTreeView and QFileSystemModel to show the contents of a directory. I want to update the view of the directory contents if the user changes the directory.
In other words, the current window looks at a default location. Users are able to change a config file to change the directory the window shows. However, they have to close the GUI and reopen to see the contents of the new directory.
I have spent about a day and a half looking at the documentation, Stack Overflow, and other locations to find some means to refresh the window, but I haven't found anything. It seems like this would be a built-in behaviour for QTreeView but I can't find it; maybe I'm looking for the wrong term. 
My code is below:
python ```
class ProjectExplorerTree(QTreeView):
  """Handles all functionality for the Project Explorer panel.
  Creates context menu for Build, Clean, Register, and Delete OpenCPI assets.
  Provides access to selected assets for use in other methods, such as Set/UnSet
  """
  def __init__(self, main_window, tree: QTreeView, console, rcc, hdl) -> None:
    """Creates the ListView/FileSystemModel for viewing"""
    super().__init__()
    self.treeView = tree
    self.default_dir = main_window.ocpi_path
    self.proj_path = main_window.user_proj_path
    self.console: OutputConsole = console
    self.rcc_target: RccTargets = rcc
    self.hdl_target: HdlTargets = hdl
    self.fileSystemModel = QFileSystemModel(self.treeView)
    self.fileSystemModel.setReadOnly(False)
    root: Optional[QModelIndex] = self.fileSystemModel.setRootPath(f"{self.proj_path}")
    self.treeView.setModel(self.fileSystemModel)
    self.treeView.hideColumn(1)
    self.treeView.hideColumn(2)
    self.treeView.hideColumn(3)
    self.treeView.setRootIndex(root)
    self.treeView.setSelectionMode(self.treeView.ExtendedSelection)
    self.treeView.setRootIsDecorated(True)
    self.treeView.setAlternatingRowColors(True)
    self.treeView.setDragEnabled(True) # Allow items to be dragged from this panel
    self.treeView.setContextMenuPolicy(Qt.CustomContextMenu)
    self.treeView.customContextMenuRequested.connect(self.context_menu)

```

I have tried using QFileSystemModel.rootPathChanged(), which didn't seem to work. I also tried using QFileSystemWatcher, which didn't do what I wanted (and it seems to already be incorporated into QFileSystemModel). I even tried using QDir.refresh(), which did nothing.
What am I missing to simply refresh the window when the config file is updated?

I don't know if this is the most correct way, but I was able to do it (manually, at least) by creating a Refresh context menu that implemented the following code:
python ```
def refresh_view(self):
  new_path = self.fileSystemModel.setRootPath(str(window.user_proj_path))
  self.treeView.setRootIndex(new_path)

```
