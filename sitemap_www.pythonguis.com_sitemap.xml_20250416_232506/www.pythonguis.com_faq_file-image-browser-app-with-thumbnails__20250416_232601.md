# File Image Browser App with thumbnails
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
Rafael_Lago | 2020-11-10 20:14:45 UTC | #1
Hey there,
I'm trying to develop some image viewer in the same vein as KDE's Gwenview, but with some very specific features for my actual application. I'll be using python 3.8 and PyQt5.
The question is: is there already any widget for browsing files in icon-mode, showing thumbnails of images, or would I have to implement that whole jazz from the scratch?
martin | 2020-11-24 10:28:12 UTC | #2
Hi @Rafael_Lago welcome to the forum, sorry for the delay in replying
Unfortunately, there isn't a ready-to-go widget for this, but it's fairly straightforward to implement. See a quick example below, which is used the [model view framework](https://www.pythonguis.com/courses/model-views/) to render thumbnails for image files in a folder. Here we're using a table view to layout the items, and a custom delegate to draw the thumbnails (you can add anything else you like).

    self.view.verticalHeader().hide()

    self.view.setItemDelegate(delegate)

    self.view.setModel(self.model)

    self.view.resizeRowsToContents()
    self.view.resizeColumnsToContents()

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
window = MainWindow()
window.show()
app.exec_()

```

If you drop this file in any folder containing jpeg files (extension "*.jpg") they'll be shown in a list.

Thank you very much! I was actually trying to develop it using QTableView, but I am not very familiar with this part of Qt5 (yet). Your code is very helpful!
Rafael_Lago | 2020-11-24 10:28:07 UTC | #4
So, I extended the concept, but using QFilesystemModel and QListView in IconMode with a given gridSize:

One of the remaining problems is that the position of the icons is not updated when I resize the window, which gives some funny results (see attached image).
I assume I have to connect some signal to some slot (i.e. resize of window to QListView.update?) but I'm not very familiar with Qt at this point to know which signal to what. Can anyone shed some light?
