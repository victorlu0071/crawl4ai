# AttributeError: type object 'Qt' has no attribute 'Alignment'
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt6 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
AstroLinux | 2021-05-13 22:25:55 UTC | #1
Hello, I get the error during run the code from _Listing 13. basic/widgets_1.py_ (page 38, "Create GUI Applications with Python & Qt6" _The hands-on guide to making apps with Python_ Version 1.0, 2021-04-09).
python ```
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/home/oleh/PycharmProjects/pythonProject5/main.py", line 24, in <module>
  window = MainWindow()
 File "/home/oleh/PycharmProjects/pythonProject5/main.py", line 17, in __init__
  widget.setAlignment( Qt.Alignment.AlignHCenter | Qt.Alignment.AlignVCenter) # <2>
AttributeError: type object 'Qt' has no attribute 'Alignment'

```

Hello, @AstroLinux, welcome to the forum!
Try changing `Qt.Alignment` to `Qt.AlignmentFlag` and it should work.

@AstroLinux this is due to a change in PyQt 6.1 (released 11th May) -- the enum names were updated to bring it in line with PySide6.
The complete guide to packaging Python GUI applications with PyInstaller.
[![Packaging Python Applications with PyInstaller](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/theme/images/products/packaging-book.png)](https://www.pythonguis.com/packaging-book/)
[Take a look ](https://www.pythonguis.com/packaging-book/)
It's a good change, as it keeps PyQt/PySide more compatible, but it does mean I need to re-do all the code examples in the book! I'll be releasing an update shortly to fix this.
edit: @AstroLinux @PedanticHacker the updated version of the PyQt6 (for 6.1) has been uploaded now. You can download it from https://account.mfitzp.com (once logged in).

There weren't _that_ many changes in the end, still I may have missed some -- let me know if you spot anything amiss. I wanted to get this out quickly as I've already have 5 emails about it this morning :D
