# Adding QComboBox to a QTableView and getting/setting values after creation
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Nov 04 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
Amit_Khanna | 2021-04-12 15:41:56 UTC | #1
Hi there,
My first post here :) I have been following the book which is very informative but I wasn't able to find a few things with MVC, especially QTableView. I would like to know how to add a QComboBox and then setting/getting its values after its created.
I managed to add the combo box with QItemDelegate but now I am not sure once it's added, how can I access it and change the items in the combo box. I mainly want to display values and once a value is selected, later get this selected value to use it in another function.
I managed to change the value too with adding a function in delegate to update the data but now this data is displayed in all combo boxes of the cell. My combo box shows versions so each row needs to show different versions in the combo box!
Any guidance or example is appreciated!
Thanks, ak
