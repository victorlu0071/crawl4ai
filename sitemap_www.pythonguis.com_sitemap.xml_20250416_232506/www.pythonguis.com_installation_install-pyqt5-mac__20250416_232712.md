# Install PyQt5 on macOS
Install PyQt5 on macOS
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Apr 01 PyQt5 [ Installation Guides ](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/)
This tutorial is also available for [PyQt6](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt6-mac/) , [PySide2](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside2-mac/) , [PySide6](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyside6-mac/) and [Tkinter](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-tkinter-mac/)
Before you start [the PyQt5 tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt5-tutorial/) you will need to have a working installation of PyQt5 on your system. If you don't have either set up yet, the following steps will guide you through how to do this on macOS.
This guide is also available for [Linux](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt-mac/) and [Windows](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt-windows/).
Note that the following instructions are _only_ for installation of the _GPL licensed_ version of PyQt. If you need to use PyQt in a non-GPL project you will need to purchase an alternative license from [Riverbank Computing](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com) to release your software.
## Install PyQt5 on macOS
If you already have a working installation of Python 3 on macOS, you can go ahead and install PyQt5 as for any other Python package, using the following --
bash ```
pip3 install pyqt5

```

If you _don't_ have an installation of Python 3, you will need to install one first. You can download macOS installers for Python 3 from the [Python homepage](https://www.python.org/). Once installed, you should be able to use the `pip3 install` command above to install PyQt5.
Another alternative is to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Homebrew is a package manager for command-line software on macOS. Homebrew has both Python 3 and PyQt5 available in their repositories.

Once Homebrew is installed you can then install Python with --

```

With Python installed, you can then install PyQt5 as normal, using `pip3 install pyqt5`, or alternatively choose to install it using Homebrew with --

**Install PyQt5 on macOS** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-pyqt5-mac/Python books) on the subject.
