# How to debug: QAbstractTableModel subclass does not call flags()
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

I have a subclass of `QAbstractTableModel` which correctly calls `data()` and `setData()` but does not call `flags()`.
Since it is correctly calling `data()` & `setData()`, I presume the initialization should be correct for the `QAbstractTableModel` as a parent class of the object. I'm also using PyCharm, and it correctly shows an icon indicating which methods are being overridden. 
I have another class with `QAbstractTableModel` as a parent class and it operates correctly. Debugging print statements flood the console in moving the mouse. So I presume something is up with the implementation of the other class.
The primary difference between the working/non-working classes is that the non-working class has multiple inheritance, defined as `class A( B, QAbstractTableModel )`
The other class has single inheritance as `class C( QAbstractTableModel )`
Since PyCharm seems to parse and identify overridden methods correctly and since the data() and `setData()` are working, I presume that initialization of the parent classes of A are correct.

Any suggestions on debugging would be appreciated.

I'm guessing that a `QLineEdit`, accessing a class derived from `QAbstractTableModel`, using the `QDataWidgetMapper`, does not call the `flags()` method of the `QAbstractTableModel`.
The doc https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/modelview.html describes standard widgets and MV widgets and depicts under section _1.3 Overview of the Model/View Widgets_.
It goes on to describe adapters, section _1.4 Using Adapters between Forms and Models_ , and references example widget `QLineEdit`.
I'm going to speculate that the `QDataWidgetMapper` will fetch and set data managed under `QAbstractItemModel` and the associated derived classes, eg `QAbstractTableModel` which I'm using, however the `QDataWidgetMapper` will not be making flags() calls to set the params of widgets, such as `QLineEdit`.

Hi @Otto_Hirr welcome to the forum & apologies for the delay in responding, I misses this when it first came in. 
I think you've hit the nail on the head re: `QLineEdit`. The `flags()` are only really relevant to the model views which are designed to handle them. The flags are requested from the model when required by the view, but standard widgets have no mechanism to do this. The `QDataWidgetMapper` would be the place to look for this perhaps, as that _does_ know about the flags mechanism and could feasibly apply changes to the widget (e.g. checkbox tristate).
Which flags were you hoping to apply to the `QLineEdit`, perhaps we can work something out.

**How to debug: QAbstractTableModel subclass does not call flags()** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/how-to-debug-qabstracttablemodel-subclass-does-not-call-flags/Python books) on the subject.
