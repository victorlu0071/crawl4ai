# Plotting with Matplotlib Tutorial -- Adding File Option
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)

Hi, I got the example to work and would love to plot from a file!
For example, I know to open a binary file is file = open("sample.bin", "rb")
But how could the data be placed into an array, for plotting? For example, assuming you prompt the user for file location, the number of bytes per data (1,2, 3 or 4), and the endiness.. i.e. the first byte is the MSB or LSB... how can I plot the data value on the y, and the sample number on the x?
