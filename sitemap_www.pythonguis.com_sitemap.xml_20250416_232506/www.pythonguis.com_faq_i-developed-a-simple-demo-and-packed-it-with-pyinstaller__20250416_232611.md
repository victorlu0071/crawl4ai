# I developed a simple demo and packed it with pyinstaller
by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) Last updated Sep 17 PyQt5 [ FAQ ](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/)
qinhong_lai | 2020-05-28 06:06:06 UTC | #1
Thank you. You have successfully solved this problem and obtained the file path and name. Now I have another problem
python ```
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QLabel, QVBoxLayout
from PyQt5.QtGui import *
import sys
class Window(QWidget):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    layout = QVBoxLayout()
    for arg in sys.argv: # <1> sys.argv is a list of strings.
      l = QLabel(arg)
      layout.addWidget(l)
    self.setWindowIcon(QIcon('resource/logo.ico'))
    self.setLayout(layout)
    self.setWindowTitle("Arguments")
app = QApplication(sys.argv)
w = Window()
w.show()
app.exec_()

```

I want to add a program icon **self.setWindowIcon(QIcon('resource/logo.ico'))** It can be displayed normally
But I use pyinstaller to package and generate exe **pyinstaller -w test20.py**
When the .MP4 video file on the desktop of the computer is opened through test20.exe, it will not be normal displayed. That's why I can only copy one picture to the desktop,This is not the way to do it ![43|404x91](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/faq/forum/i-developed-a-simple-demo-and-packed-it-with-pyinstaller/4v9bCxJAfij0g7uY8AyvAtBsvO2.png)

Ah, that's interesting -- you when you run it as a packaged app, the exe file is the first argument? That's kind of helpful. In that case you can just use `sys.argv[1]` or get the last argument in the list, e.g.

```

I'm not sure what you mean here?
Are you having problems setting the icon for the executable? In the PyInstaller tutorial https://www.pythonguis.com/courses/packaging-and-distribution/packaging-pyqt5-pyside2-applications-windows-pyinstaller/ it explains the problem -- add the following to the top of your file.
The complete guide to packaging Python GUI applications with PyInstaller.

[Take a look ](https://www.pythonguis.com/packaging-book/)
python ```
from PyQt5.QtWinExtras import QtWin
myappid = 'com.qinhong.something'
QtWin.setCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID(myappid)

```

and the icon should work as expected.
That tutorial also explains how to bundle the icons with your app.

**I developed a simple demo and packed it with pyinstaller** was written by [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/authors/martin-fitzpatrick/) . 
Martin Fitzpatrick has been developing Python/Qt apps for 8 years. Building desktop applications to make data-analysis tools more user-friendly, Python was the obvious choice. Starting with Tk, later moving to wxWidgets and finally adopting PyQt. Martin founded PythonGUIs to provide easy to follow GUI programming tutorials to the Python community. He has written a number of popular [https://www.martinfitzpatrick.com/browse/books/](https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/i-developed-a-simple-demo-and-packed-it-with-pyinstaller/Python books) on the subject.
