# QSystemTrayIcon example

Trying to extend the `QSystemTrayIcon` example by using a for loop to populate the menu only the last item in the list gets used in the menu. Why is this, and what would be the proper way to do this? In the real world, the contents of `entries` would be determined programatically rather than hardcoded.
python ```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QSystemTrayIcon, QMenu, QAction
from PyQt5.QtGui import QIcon

app = QApplication([])
app.setQuitOnLastWindowClosed(False)
icon = QIcon.fromTheme("application")
tray = QSystemTrayIcon()
tray.setIcon(icon)
tray.setVisible(True)
menu = QMenu()
entries = ["One", "Two", "Three"]
for entry in entries:
  action = QAction(entry)
  menu.addAction(action)
  action.triggered.connect(app.quit)
tray.setContextMenu(menu)
app.exec_()

```

Results in:

What happened to **One** and **Two**?
python ```
% python3 --version
Python 3.7.9
% pkg search Qt | grep py37-qt5-5
py37-qt5-5.15.2

```

Hi @probono 
[Packaging Python Applications with PyInstaller](https://www.pythonguis.com/packaging-book/) _by Martin Fitzpatrick_ — This step-by-step guide walks you through packaging your own Python applications from simple examples to complete installers and signed executables.

Normally these sorts of issues are the result of things going out of scope. In Python, unless you retain a reference to an object in the current scope it will be garbage collected. In your code, the `action` object is being replaced on each iteration -- so on the second loop, the first `action` object no longer has a reference anywhere, and is deleted. This in turn deletes the Qt object, and removes it from the menu.
All you need to do is keep a reference to each `action`, for example in a list (here `actions`).
