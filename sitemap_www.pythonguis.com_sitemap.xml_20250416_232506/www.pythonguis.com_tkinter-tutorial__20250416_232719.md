#  Tkinter Tutorial 
##  Build your own desktop apps with Python & Tkinter 
### Python's built-in GUI library
Last updated 12 January 2025
![Create Desktop GUI Applications with Tkinter](https://www.pythonguis.com/static/images/tkinter/tkinter.png)
Tkinter is a Python library for creating GUI applications using the Tk toolkit. Tkinter comes bundled with Python on both Windows and macOS. (On Linux, it may require downloading an additional package from your distribution's repo.) Tkinter is a wrapper written around the Tk GUI toolkit. Its name is an amalgamation of the words _Tk_ and _Interface_.
Tkinter is a simple library with support for standard layouts and widgets, as well as more complex widgets such as tabbed views & progressbars. Tkinter is a pure GUI library, not a framework. There is no built-in support for GUIs driven from data sources, databases, or for displaying or manipulating multimedia or hardware. However, if you need to make something simple that doesn't require any additional dependencies, Tkinter may be what you are looking for.

## Packaging and Distributing Tkinter Applications
### Sharing your Tkinter applications with other people
There comes a point in any app's development where it needs to leave home — half the fun in writing software is being able to share it with other people. Packaging Python GUI apps can be a little tricky, but in this Tkinter tutorial we'll cover how to package up your apps to share, whether commercially or just for fun.
